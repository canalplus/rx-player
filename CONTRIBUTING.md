# Contributing to the RxPlayer

## Issues and new features

If you detect a problem with the RxPlayer, or if you desire a new feature,
please first [open an issue on the github's
repository](https://github.com/canalplus/rx-player/issues).
We'll try to acknowledge it as soon as possible.

If that issue is not already worked on, we will usually accept pull requests.
Those have to follow the conventions defined below.



## Important code concepts

### Code documentation

We try to put `README.md` files inside every significant directories inside
`/src` to provide a global architecture documentation of that directory
specifically.

You can try to start understanding a piece of RxPlayer code by navigating
to that file. Understand that the documented behavior may be out of date
(in which case you're welcome to update it or open an issue) though even in
that case, it is a good starting point to understand the directory's role.
Likewise, don't forget to update it if a change you made to the code
necessitates a documentation change.

Also, for a more exhaustive approach to the documentation of the project's file
organization, you can look at [`FILES.md`](./FILES.md).

### When renaming or deleting functions, classes or variables

When Refactoring/Renaming, make sure to grep any of the renamed class / function
/ variable's name as they may also be referenced in documentation and code
comments. Same thing for a directory or file name.

If the name is hard to grep (e.g. the name is too generic and thus has too many
false positives), you can generally reduce the area to comments in the same file
and documentation files in the same directory.

### `features` object

Some files should not be imported directly but only be accessed by going through
the `features` object exported at `/src/features`. This is to reduce bundle size
when an application doesn't need all of the RxPlayer's features.



## Code style

### Linting

The code style in `src` is automatically checked by a "linter", `eslint`.

It basically follows those principles:
  - 2 spaces indentation
  - 90 columns maximum
  - readability and being explicit is generally better than performance and
    being smart

You can easily check if you followed our style rules by calling `npm run lint`.

You can also check the style of the demo page (in the `demo` directory) by
calling `npm run lint:demo`, or the style of the test files (in the `tests`
directory) by calling `npm run lint:tests`.


### Types

We try to be as strict as possible with types:

  - the `any` type should be avoided

  - the `as` TypeScript keyword, used for type casting, should also be avoided
    as much as possible.

This is to be sure we can detect as much as possible type errors automatically
with TypeScript.

### `type` and `interface` typing

TypeScript's `type` and `interface` should all be named beginning with the
letter `I`, for easier identification purposes\*:
```ts
interface IMyObject {
  someKey: string;
}

type IStringOrNumber = string |
                       number;
```

`enum`s and `const enum`s, which have the particularity in TypeScript of
actually having an influence on the outputed code, do not follow this rule
however (because those are not just types erased during transpilation):
```ts
enum MyEnum {
  ValueA = 1,
  ValueB = 2,
}

const enum MyConstEnum {
  Value1 = 1,
  Value2 = 2,
}
```

\*We know that this rule is a controversial subject amongst TypeScript
developpers, yet we still decide to enforce it for now.

### Forbidden functions and classes

Some native functions, methods or classes should never be used to ensure
compatibility with most browsers. To work around those, we usually rely on
"ponyfills" which are JavaScript re-implementations.

This concerns the following static methods:
  - `Object.assign`: use `src/utils/object_assign.ts` instead
  - `Object.values`: use `src/utils/object_values.ts` instead

And the following methods:
  - `Array.prototype.includes`: use `src/utils/array_includes.ts` instead
  - `Array.prototype.find`: use `src/utils/array_find.ts` instead
  - `Array.prototype.findIndex`: use `src/utils/array_find_index.ts` instead
  - `String.prototype.startsWith`: use `src/utils/starts_with.ts` instead
  - `String.prototype.substr`: use `String.prototype.substring` instead
  - `NodeList.prototype.forEach`: use a regular for loop instead
  - `Promise.prototype.finally`: Use `then` or both `then` and `catch` of that
    Promise's methods instead.


## The demo page

### Building the demo and serving it

You might want to quickly test your code modification(s) on a real use case.

For those types of need, we developped two demo pages:

  - the _full demo_ page, which is also the one used to showcase the player.

    This demo has a user-friendly interface and allow the most frequent API
    interactions.

    It also exposes both the RxPlayer class through `window.RxPlayer` and the
    rxPlayer instance through `window.rxPlayer` - both in the global scope. You
    can thus open a debugger/inspector in your favorite browser to exploit
    directly the player's API.

  - the _standalone demo_ page, which is just a `<video />` tag linked to a
    RxPlayer instance.

    In this demo too, `window.RxPlayer` and `window.rxPlayer` link to the
    RxPlayer class and the rxPlayer instance respectively.

To use the full demo page, you can build it and run a local HTTP server on the
port 8000 by running the following npm script.
```sh
npm run start
```

To use the standalone demo page, you can build it and run a local HTTP server on
the port 8001 by running the following npm script.
```sh
npm run standalone
```

Both will detect when the RxPlayer's files (or even the demo files) are updated
and perform a new build when that's the case. In that way, the server will
always serve the last local version of the code. Note however that hot-reload is
not enabled currently, you'll have to refresh the page yourself.

### Serving the demo page through HTTPS

You might want to serve the demo via HTTPS. This is for example needed to be
able to play encrypted contents in Chrome.

Thankfully, we have an npm script which generates a local self-signed
certificate with the help of `openssl`:
```sh
npm run certificate
```

You can then run the same demo script defined previously.
The _full demo_ will now serve HTTPS through the port 8443 and the _standalone
demo_ through the port 8444. Both still serve HTTP on the same ports than
before.

Note that such self-signed certificates are usually (rightfully) considered
suspicious by web browsers. As such, you might first encounter a warning screen
when going to one of the demo pages in HTTPS. In most browsers, you can however
safely ignore that warning.


## Creating a commit

### Checks

Every commits in a PR should pass our quick checks (linter and TypeScript
check). To check if that's the case, you can run locally the `check`
script by calling `npm run check`.


## The test suite

### Unit tests

Unit tests test function implementations. Mostly to check if they give a sane
output for every input given.

Writing unit tests for new code is encouraged.

Unit tests are written in a \_\_tests\_\_ directory, itself created in the same
directory that the code it tests.

They are written and run with the help of the Jest library and are named the
following way: `filename_containing_the_function_tested.test.ts`.

To understand how to create a new test file, you can take inspiration from
the current unit tests.


### Integration tests

What we call integration tests are tests testing the entire API of the RxPlayer.

New integration tests are not required when a new code is added. Just make sure
that all those tests pass before doing a pull request by running:
`npm run test:integration`.

It you want to improve our integration tests, you are welcome to do so.
Those are wrote in `tests/integration` with the help of the Mocha, Chai and
Sinon libraries.

We also use a homemade library and server to serve media contents to our tests.
If you want to know how it works, we invite you to rely on the already created
tests and to read the corresponding files.


### Memory tests

Memory tests replicate simple scenarios and try to detect memory leaks.

You can also help us improving our memory tests. Those are written in
`test/memory`. The testing stack used is Mocha, Chai and Sinon.



## Documentation

The documentation is written in the `doc` directory, at the root of the project.

The content of `doc/generated` contains an HTML version of the Markdown files
written in the other directories. It is automatically generated from those by
calling the `doc` script through `npm run doc`.



## Opening a pull request

### Which branch to merge to

Pull requests for bug fixes, new tests or documentation should be done on the
`master` branch.

Pull requests for new features and breaking changes will have to be performed
on the `next` branch.

If you don't know on which branch to do a pull request, please open it on
`master`, we will know how to redirect it to the right one.
