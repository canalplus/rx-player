# The Stream ###################################################################


## Overview ####################################################################

Even if the API is the front-facing block of code in the Rx-player, the Stream
is the part of the code actually starting the logic behind playing a content.

Its code is written in the ``src/core/stream`` directory. More specifically,
all code needed in the rest of the code should be exported by its "index file"
``src/core/stream/index.ts``.

Every times you're calling the API to load a new video, the Stream function is
called by it with a handful of arguments.

The Stream does then the major part of the job and communicate back its progress
to the API through events.

```
                 +-----------+
 1. LOAD VIDEO   |           |      2. CALLS
---------------> |    API    | -------------------+
                 |           |                    |
                 +-----------+                    |
                       ^                          v
                       |                    +--------------+
                       |   3. EMIT EVENTS   |              |
                       +------------------- |    STREAM    |
                                            |              |
                                            +--------------+
```

Basically, the job of the Stream is to:

  - initialize the content (creating the MediaSource, downloading the manifest)

  - Connect most core parts of the player together, such as adaptive
    streaming management, DRMs, speed management...

  - Call with the right argument the PeriodBufferManager, which will download
    and push segment to be decoded by the browser.

As such, during the various events happening on content playback, the Stream
will create / destroy / update various player blocks. Such example of blocks
are:

  - Adaptive streaming management

  - DRM management

  - Manifest loading, parsing and refreshing

  - Buffer management

  - ...



## Usage #######################################################################

Concretely, the Stream is a function which returns an Observable.
This Observable:

  - will automatically load the described content on subscription

  - will automatically stop and clean-up infos related to the content on
    unsubscription

  - communicate on various streaming events through emitted notifications

  - throw in the case of a fatal error (error interruption playback)


### Communication between the API and the Stream ###############################

Objects emitted by the Observable is the only way the Stream should be able to
communicate with the API.

The API is then able to communicate back to the Stream, either:

  - by Observable provided by the API as arguments when the Stream function was
    called

  - by emitting through Subject provided by the Stream, as a payload of one of
    its event

Thus, there is three ways the API and Stream can communicate:

  - API -> Stream: When the Stream function is called (so a single time)

  - Stream -> API: Through events emitted by the returned Observable

  - API -> Stream: Through Observables/Subjects the Stream is in possession of.


### Emitted Events #############################################################

Events allows the Stream to reports milestones of the content playback, such as
when the content has been loaded.

It's also a way for the Stream to communicate informations about the content and
give some controls to the user.

For example, as available audio languages are only known after the manifest has
been downloaded and parsed, and as it is most of all a user preference, the
Stream can emit to the API RxJS Subjects allowing the API to "choose" at any
time the wanted language.



## Building blocks #############################################################

The Stream put in relation multiple part of the code to allow a qualitative
playback experience.

Multiple of those building bricks are considered as part of the Stream.

Among them, you can find:

  - __[the Buffer Garbage Collector](./buffer_garbage_collector.md)__

    Perform manual garbage collection on SourceBuffers periodically


  - __[the Segment Bookkeeper](./segment_bookkeeper.md)__

    Keep track of the informations of every segments currently present in the
    buffer, e.g. to know which part of the buffer are linked to which
    quality/language etc.

    Also useful to know when segments have automatically been garbage-collected
    by the browser.


  - __[the Speed Manager](./speed_manager.md)__

    Handle playback rate management. To pause when we should build buffer, for
    example, and speed-up/lower-up the playback rate when the user ask for this.


  - __the Stalling Manager__

    Try to un-stall the player when it does so.



## Buffer creation #############################################################


>   - __[the Buffer Handler](./period_buffer_creator.md)__

>     Create/destroy the Buffer and SourceBuffers needed, that will be used to
>     push new media segments.
