# getLockedAudioRepresentations

## Description

Get the last audio Representations manually locked through the
[`lockAudioRepresentations`](./lockAudioVideoRepresentations.md) method.

Returns `null` when no audio Representation is locked.

Without arguments, it returns the list of locked audio Representation for the current
[`Period`](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period). You can also get the list for any
Period by providing its `id` property as argument.

```js
// example: getting Representations locked for the first Period
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getLockedAudioRepresentations(periods[0].id);
```

## Syntax

```js
// Get information about the locked audio Representation for the current Period
const lockedAudioRepresentations = player.getLockedAudioRepresentations();

// Get information about the locked audio Representation for a specific Period
const lockedAudioRepresentations = player.getLockedAudioRepresentations(periodId);
```

- **arguments**:

  1.  _periodId_ `string|undefined`: The `id` of the Period for which you want to get its
      locked audio Representation. If not defined, the information associated to the
      currently-playing Period will be returned.

- **return value**: `Array.<string>|null`: Last locked audio Representation for the
  corresponding Period `null` if no audio Representation is locked.
