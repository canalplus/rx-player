# getAudioRepresentation

## Description

Get information about the audio Representation currently loaded.

Note that this only returns the audio Representation that is _loaded_ which may be
different to the one that is _played_.

The returned value can either be an object or:

- `null` if no audio track is enabled right now.
- `undefined` if no audio content has been loaded yet or if its information is unknown.

In case it a audio track is set and its properties is known, the `getAudioRepresentation`
method will return an object with the following properties:

- `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation. No other audio
  Representation for the same [Period](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period) will have
  the same `id`.

  This can be useful when locking the Representation through the
  [`lockAudioRepresentations`](./lockAudioVideoRepresentations.md) method.

- `bitrate` (`Number|undefined`): The bitrate of this Representation, in bits per seconds.

  `undefined` if unknown.

- `codec` (`string|undefined`): The audio codec the Representation is in, as announced in
  the corresponding Manifest.

You can also get the information on the loaded audio Representation for another Period by
calling `getAudioRepresentation` with the corresponding Period's id in argument. Such id
can be obtained through the `getAvailablePeriods` method, the `newAvailablePeriods` event
or the `periodChange` event.

```js
// example: getting Representation information for the first Period
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAudioRepresentation(periods[0].id);
```

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>), this method
returns "undefined".
</div>

## Syntax

```js
// Get information about the currently-loaded audio Representation
const audioRepresentation = player.getAudioRepresentation();

// Get information about the loaded audio Representation for a specific Period
const audioRepresentation = player.getAudioRepresentation(periodId);
```

- **arguments**:

  1.  _periodId_ `string|undefined`: The `id` of the Period for which you want to get
      information about its currently loaded audio Representation. If not defined, the
      information associated to the currently-playing Period will be returned.

- **return value** `Object|null|undefined`
