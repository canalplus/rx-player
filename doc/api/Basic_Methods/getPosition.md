# getPosition

## Description

Returns the current media element's playing position, in seconds.

For live contents, the returned position will not be re-scaled to correspond to a live
timestamp. If you want that behavior, you can call `getWallClockTime` instead.

This is the only difference between the two. Generally, you can follow the following rule:

- if you want to use that current position to use it with the other APIs (like `seekTo`,
  `getMinimumPosition`, `getMaximumPosition` etc.) use `getPosition` - as this is the real
  position in the media.

- if you want to display the current position to the viewer/listener, use
  `getWallClockTime` instead - as it will be set in the proper scale for live contents to
  display the right live time.

## Syntax

```js
const position = player.getPosition();
```

- **return value** `number`: The current media element's position.

## Example

```js
const pos = player.getPosition();
console.log(`The video element's current position is: ${pos} second(s)`);
```
