# getAvailablePeriods

## Description

Returns information on all [Periods](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period)
currently considered by the RxPlayer in the current content.

This method mainly allows to obtain information on its audio, video or text
tracks as well as on audio and video Representations - and to change any of
them - by using the corresponding Period's `id` property returned here.

The value returned by this method is an array of object, each describing a
single Period in chronological order.
Those objects all contain the following properties:

  - `start` (`number`): The starting position at which the Period starts, in
    seconds.

  - `end` (`number|undefined`): The position at which the Period ends, in
    seconds.

    `undefined` either if not known or if the Period has no end yet (e.g. for
    live contents, the end might not be known for now).

  - `id` (`string`): `id` for this Period, allowing to call track and
    Representation selection APIs (such as `setAudioTrack` and
    `lockVideoRepresentations` for example) even if that Period is not currently
    playing.

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>),
this method might just return an empty array.

## Syntax
