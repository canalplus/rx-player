# getLivePosition

## Description

Returns the position in seconds in the current media corresponding to live
content.

Returns `null` if no content is currently loaded or if the current content is
not considered a live content.

Returns `undefined` if we cannot know the position corresponding to live
content currently.

Note that the live position is technically different than the maximum position
returned by [`getMaximumPosition`](./getMaximumPosition.md):

  - `getMaximumPosition` returns the maximum position with content that may be
    loaded. It may be further than the live position if future content is
    already available (e.g. ad breaks already present in a Manifest) or may
    be sooner if the live position is not yet available.

  - `getLivePosition` just gives the information on the position which is
    intended to correspond to the live content.

## Syntax

```js
const livePosition = player.getLivePosition();
```

  - **return value** `number|null|undefined`: position for the live content, in
    seconds.
    `null` if no content is loaded or if the current loaded content is
    not considered as a live content.
    `undefined` if that live position is currently unknown.

## Example

```js
// playing 5 seconds before the live
player.seekTo({
  position: player.getLivePosition() - 5,
});
```
