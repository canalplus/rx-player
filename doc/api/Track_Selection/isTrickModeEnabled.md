# isTrickModeEnabled

## Description

It tells if the trick mode is currently enabled for the content playback :
The trick mode allows to play content fast-forward in an efficient way, by
exploiting trick mode tracks : on these specific tracks, video content is often
encoded with a very low framerate because the content is not intended to be
played at regular framerate and because the chunks must be faster to load for
the client.

## Syntax

```js
const isTrickModeEnabled = player.isTrickModeEnabled();
```

 - **return value** `boolean`
