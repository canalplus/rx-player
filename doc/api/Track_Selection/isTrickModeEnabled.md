# isTrickModeEnabled

## Description

Tells if trick mode tracks are currently enabled if available.

Trick mode tracks are video tracks with a generally lower frame rate, allowing for example
to play content fast-forward in an efficient way.

Note that `isTrickModeEnabled` returning `true` does not always mean that a video trick
mode track is currently displayed, as it depends on whether it is actually available on
the current content.

You can know if a trick mode video track is currently playing by checking if the track
returned by the [`getVideoTrack`](./getVideoTrack.md) method has its `isTrickModeTrack`
property set to `true`.

## Syntax

```js
const isTrickModeEnabled = player.isTrickModeEnabled();
```

- **return value** `boolean`
