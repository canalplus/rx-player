# getAvailableVideoTracks

## Description

Returns the list of available video tracks for the current content.

Each of the objects in the returned array have the following properties:

  - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify the track. Use it for
    setting the track via `setVideoTrack`.

  - `active` (`Boolean`): Whether this track is the one currently
    active or not.

  - `representations` (`Array.<Object>`):
    [Representations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) of this
    video track, with attributes:

    - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation.

    - `bitrate` (`Number`): The bitrate of this Representation, in bits per
      seconds.

    - `width` (`Number|undefined`): The width of video, in pixels.

    - `height` (`Number|undefined`): The height of video, in pixels.

    - `codec` (`string|undefined`): The video codec the Representation is
      in, as announced in the corresponding Manifest.

    - `frameRate` (`number|undefined`): The video framerate.

    - `hdrInfo` (`Object|undefined`) Information about the hdr
      characteristics of the track.
      (see [HDR support documentation](../Miscellaneous/hdr.md#hdrinfo))

  - `signInterpreted` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, the track is
    known to contain an interpretation in sign language.
    If set to `false`, the track is known to not contain that type of content.
    If not set or set to undefined we don't know whether that video track
    contains an interpretation in sign language.


  - `trickModeTracks` (`Array.<Object> | undefined`): Trick mode video tracks
    attached to this video track.

    Each of those objects contain the same properties that a regular video track
    (same properties than what is documented here).

    It this property is either `undefined` or not set, then this track has no
    linked trickmode video track.
