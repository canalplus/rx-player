# getAvailableVideoTracks

## Description

Returns the list of available video tracks for the current content.

Each of the objects in the returned array have the following properties:

- `id` (`string`): The id used to identify the track. Use it for setting the track via
  `setVideoTrack`.

- `active` (`Boolean`): Whether this track is the one currently active or not.

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in the user
  interface providing a choice between video tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `representations` (`Array.<Object>`):
  [Representations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) of this video track,
  with attributes:

  - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation.

  - `bitrate` (`Number|undefined`): The bitrate of this Representation, in bits per
    seconds.

    `undefined` if unknown.

  - `width` (`Number|undefined`): The width of video, in pixels.

  - `height` (`Number|undefined`): The height of video, in pixels.

  - `codec` (`string|undefined`): The video codec the Representation is in, as announced
    in the corresponding Manifest.

  - `frameRate` (`number|undefined`): The video framerate.

  - `hdrInfo` (`Object|undefined`) Information about the hdr characteristics of the track.
    (see [HDR support documentation](../Miscellaneous/hdr.md#hdrinfo))

  - `isCodecSupported` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the codec(s) of that
    Representation is supported by the current platform.

    Note that because elements of the `representations` array only contains playable
    Representation, this value here cannot be set to `false` when in this array.

    `undefined` (or not set) if support of that Representation is unknown or if does not
    make sense here.

  - `decipherable` (`Boolean|undefined`): If `true` the Representation can be deciphered
    (in the eventuality it had DRM-related protection).

    Note that because elements of the `representations` array only contains playable
    Representation, this value here cannot be set to `false` when in this array.

- `signInterpreted` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, the track is known to contain
  an interpretation in sign language. If set to `false`, the track is known to not contain
  that type of content. If not set or set to undefined we don't know whether that video
  track contains an interpretation in sign language.

- `trickModeTracks` (`Array.<Object> | undefined`): Trick mode video tracks attached to
  this video track.

  Each of those objects contain the same properties that a regular video track (same
  properties than what is documented here).

  It this property is either `undefined` or not set, then this track has no linked
  trickmode video track.

You can also get the list of available video tracks for a specific Period by calling
`getAvailableVideoTracks` with the corresponding Period's id in argument. Such id can be
obtained through the `getAvailablePeriods` method, the `newAvailablePeriods` event or the
`periodChange` event.

```js
// example: getting the video track list for the first Period
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
console.log(rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks(periods[0].id);
```

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>), if there is no
supported tracks in the file or no track management API in the browser this
method will return an empty Array.
</div>

## Syntax

```js
// Get list of available video tracks for the currently-playing Period
const videoTracks = player.getAvailableVideoTracks();

// Get list of available video tracks for a specific Period
const videoTrack = player.getAvailableVideoTracks(periodId);
```

- **arguments**:

  1.  _periodId_ `string|undefined`: The `id` of the Period for which you want to get the
      list of available video tracks. If not defined, this method will return the list of
      video tracks for the currently-playing Period.

- **return value** `Array.<Object>`
