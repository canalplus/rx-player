# disableTextTrack

## Description

Disable the current text track, if one.

After calling that method, no subtitles track will be displayed until `setTextTrack` is
called.

Note for multi-Period contents:

This method will only have an effect on the
[Period](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period) that is currently playing.

If you want to disable the text track for other Periods as well, you might want to call
[setPreferredVideoTracks](./setPreferredVideoTracks.md) instead. With this method, you can
globally apply a `null` text track preference - which means that you would prefer having
no text track - by setting its second argument to `true`.

More information can be found on that API's documentation.

## Syntax

```js
player.disableTextTrack();
```
