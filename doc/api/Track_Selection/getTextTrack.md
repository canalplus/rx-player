# getTextTrack

## Description

Get information about the text track currently set.
`null` if no audio track is enabled right now.

If a text track is set and information about it is known, this method will
return an object with the following properties:

- `id` (`Number|string`): The id used to identify this track. No other
  text track for the same [Period](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period) will have the same
  `id`.

  This can be useful when setting the track through the `setTextTrack` method.

- `language` (`string`): The language the text trac./../Basic_Methods/loadVideo.md#transport set in the
  [Manifest](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#manifest).

- `normalized` (`string`): An attempt to translate the `language`
  property into an ISO 639-3 language code (for now only support translations
  from ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-3 language codes). If the translation attempt
  fails (no corresponding ISO./../Basic_Methods/loadVideo.md#transport found), it will equal the
  value of `language`

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in
  the user interface providing a choice between text tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `closedCaption` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is specially adapted for
  the hard of hearing or not.

- `forced` (`Boolean`): If `true` this text track is meant to be displayed by
  default if no other text track is selected.

  It is often used to clarify dialogue, alternate languages, texted graphics or
  location and person identification.

`undefined` if no text content has been loaded yet or if its information is
unknown.
