# getAvailableTextTracks

## Description

Returns the list of available text tracks (subtitles) for the current content.

Each of the objects in the returned array have the following properties:

- `id` (`string`): The id used to identify the track. Use it for
  setting the track via `setTextTrack`.

- `language` (`string`): The language the text track is in, as set in the
  [Manifest](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#manifest).

- `normalized` (`string`): An attempt to translate the `language`
  property into an ISO 639-3 language code (for now only support translations
  from ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 language codes). If the translation attempt
  fails (no corresponding ISO 639-3 language code is found), it will equal the
  value of `language`

- `closedCaption` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is specially adapted for
  the hard of hearing or not.

- `forced` (`Boolean`): If `true` this text track is meant to be displayed by
  default if no other text track is selected.

  It is often used to clarify dialogue, alternate languages, texted graphics or
  location and person identification.

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in
  the user interface providing a choice between text tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `active` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is the one currently active or
  not.
