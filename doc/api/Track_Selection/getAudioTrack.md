# getAudioTrack

## Description

Get information about the audio track currently set.
`null` if no audio track is enabled right now.

If an audio track is set and information about it is known, this method will
return an object with the following properties:

- `id` (`Number|string`): The id used to identify this track. No other
  audio track for the same [Period](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#period) will have the
  same `id`.

  This can be useful when setting the track through the `setAudioTrack`
  method.

- `language` (`string`): The language the audio track is in, as set in the
  [Manifest](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#manifest).

- `normalized` (`string`): An attempt to translate the `language`
  property into an ISO 639-3 language code (for now only support translations
  from ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-3 language codes). If the translation attempt
  fails (no corresponding ISO 639-3 language code is found), it will equal the
  value of `language`

- `audioDescription` (`Boolean`): Whether the track is an audio
  description of what is happening at the screen.

- `dub` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, this audio track is a
  "dub", meaning it was recorded in another language than the original.
  If set to `false`, we know that this audio track is in an original language.
  This property is `undefined` if we do not known whether it is in an original
  language.

- `label` (`string|undefined`): A human readable label that may be displayed in
  the user interface providing a choice between audio tracks.

  This information is usually set only if the current Manifest contains one.

- `representations` (`Array.<Object>`):
  [Representations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) of this video track, with
  attributes:

  - `id` (`string`): The id used to identify this Representation.
    No other Representation from this track will have the same `id`.

  - `bitrate` (`Number|undefined`): The bitrate of this Representation, in
    bits per seconds.

    `undefined` if unknown.

  - `codec` (`string|undefined`): The audio codec the Representation is
    in, as announced in the corresponding Manifest.

  - `isSpatialAudio` (`Boolean|undefined`): If set to `true`, this Representation
    has spatial audio.

`undefined` if no audio content has been loaded yet or if its information is
unknown.
