# disableVideoTrack

## Description

Disable the current video track, if one.

Might enter in `RELOADING` state for a short period after calling this API.

You can also disable the video track for another Period by calling
`disableVideoTrack` with the corresponding Period's id in argument. Such id can
be obtained through the `getAvailablePeriods` method, the `newAvailablePeriods`
event or the `periodChange` event.

```js
// example: disabling the video track for all Periods
const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
for (const period of periods) {
  rxPlayer.disableVideoTrack(period.id);
}
```

<div class="warning">
This option may have no effect in <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
<br>
<br>
The directfile mode is a special case here because when in it, the RxPlayer
depends for track selection on the
<a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html"> corresponding HTML
standard</a> as implemented by the different browsers.
<br>
Though this standard says nothing about not being able to disable the video
track (or to stay more in line with their terms: to not select any video track),
no browser implementation actually seem to be able to do it, even when the
corresponding browser APIs show that no video track is currently selected.
This might be a bug on their parts.
<br>
<br>
Due to this fact, we do not recommend using this API in directfile mode for
now. You might even receive a reassuring `videoTrackChange` event (with a `null`
payload) while the video track is still actually active.
