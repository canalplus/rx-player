# Plugins

## Overview

To allow the player to be extended, a system of "plugins" has been added.

Those plugins are often under the form of functions passed as an argument to the ``loadVideo`` API call.

## <a name="segmentLoader"></a>segmentLoader

The segmentLoader is a function that can be included in the ``transportOptions`` of the ``loadVideo`` API call.

A segmentLoader allows to define a custom audio/video segment loader (it might on the future work for other types of segments, so always check the type if you only want those two).

The segment loader is the part performing the segment request. One usecase where you might want to set your own segment loader is to integrate Peer-to-Peer segment downloading through the player.

To give a complete example, here is a segment loader which uses an XHR (it has no use, as our implementation does the same thing and more):
```js
/**
 * @param {Object} infos - infos about the segment to download
 * @param {string} infos.url - the url the segment request should normally be on
 * @param {Object} infos.adaptation - the adaptation containing the segment.
 * More information on its structure can be found on the documentation linked
 * below [1]
 * @param {Object} infos.representation - the representation containing the
 * segment.
 * More information on its structure can be found on the documentation linked
 * below [2]
 * @param {Object} infos.segment - the segment itself
 * More information on its structure can be found on the documentation linked
 * below [3]

 * @param {Object} callbacks
 * @param {Function} callbacks.resolve - Callback to call when the request is
 * finished with success. It should be called with an object with at least 3
 * properties:
 *   - data {ArrayBuffer} - the segment data
 *   - duration {Number} - the duration of the request, in ms
 *   - size {Number} - size, in bytes, of the total downloaded response.
 * @param {Function} callbacks.reject - Callback to call when an error is
 * encountered. If you relied on an XHR, it is recommended to include it as an
 * object property named "xhr" in the argument.
 * @param {Function} callbacks.fallback - Callback to call if you want to call
 * our default implementation instead for this segment. No argument is needed.

 * @returns {Function|undefined} - If a function is defined in the return value,
 * it will be called if and when the request is canceled.

const customSegmentLoader = (infos, callbacks) => {

  // we will only use this custom loader for videos segments.
  if (infos.adaptation.type !== "video") {
    callbacks.fallback();
    return;
  }

  const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
  const sentTime = Date.now();

  xhr.onload = (r) => {
    if (200 <= xhr.status && xhr.status < 300) {
      const duration = Date.now() - sentTime;
      const size = r.total;
      const data = r.responseData;
      callbacks.resolve({ duration, size, data });
    } else {
      const err = new Error("didn't work");
      err.xhr = xhr;
      callbacks.reject(err);
    }
  };

  xhr.onerror = () => {
    const err = new Error("didn't work");
    err.xhr = xhr;
    callbacks.reject(err);
  };

  xhr.open("GET", infos.url);
  xhr.responseType = "arraybuffer";

  const range = infos.segment.range;
  if (range) {
    if (range[1] && range[1] !== Infinity) {
      xhr.setRequestHeader("Range", `bytes=${range[0]}-${range[1]}`);
    } else {
      xhr.setRequestHeader("Range", `bytes=${range[0]}-`);
