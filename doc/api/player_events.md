<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview ####################################################################

To communicate about events (like an error or the update of the current video
bitrate) the player use the event listener pattern.

As [documented in the API](./index.md#meth-addEventListener), you can call
``addEventListener`` to register a callback for a particular event, like:

```js
player.addEventListener("videoBitrateChange", (newVideoBitrate) => {
  console.log("the video bitrate changed to:", newVideoBitrate)
});
```

You can unregister a callback through the ``removeEventListener`` API,
documented [here](./index.md#meth-removeEventListener).



<a name="events"></a>
## Events ######################################################################

This chapter describes every event sent by the player. Each event generally
comes with a payload, which will also be defined here.


<a name="events-playerStateChange"></a>
### playerStateChange ##########################################################

_payload type_: ``string``

Emit the current state of the player, every time it changes.

As it is a central part of our API and can be difficult concept to understand,
we have a special [page of documentation on player states](./states.md).


<a name="events-positionUpdate"></a>
### positionUpdate #############################################################

_payload type_: ``Object``

Emit information about the current position at most every seconds (also emits
every time various player events are received).

The object emitted as the following properties:

  - ``position`` (``Number``): The current position in the video, in seconds.

  - ``duration`` (``Number``): The duration of the content.

  - ``bufferGap`` (``Number``): The gap, in seconds, between the current
    position and the end of the current buffered range.

  -  ``playbackRate`` (``Number``): The current playback rate the content is on.

  - ``liveGap`` (``Number|undefined``): Only for live contents. The gap between
    the current position and the "live edge".

  - ``maximumBufferTime`` (``Number|undefined``): The maximum time until which
    the buffer can currently be filled. That is:

    - for static contents (like VoD), the duration.

    - for dynamic contents (like live contents), the current maximum available
      position (live edge for live contents) minus a security margin we added to
      avoid buffering ahead of it.

  - ``wallClockTime`` (``Number|undefined``): Only for live contents. The
    current time converted to wall-clock time in seconds.
    That is the real live position (and not the position as announced by the
    video element).



<a name="events-availableAudioTracksChange"></a>
### availableAudioTracksChange #################################################

_payload type_: ``Array.<Object>``

---

:warning: This event is not sent in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](./loadVideo_options.md#prop-transport)).

---

Triggered when the currently available audio tracks change (e.g.: at the
beginning of the content, when period changes...).

The array emitted contains object describing each available audio track:

  - ``active`` (``Boolean``): Whether the track is the one currently active or
    not.

  - ``id`` (``string``): The id used to identify the track. Use it for
    setting the track via ``setAudioTrack``.

  - ``language`` (``string``): The language the audio track is in, as set in
    the [Manifest](../terms.md#manifest).

  - ``normalized`` (``string``): An attempt to translate the ``language``
    property into an ISO 639-3 language code (for now only support translations
    from ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2 language codes). If the translation attempt
    fails (no corresponding ISO 639-3 language code is found), it will equal the
    value of ``language``

  - ``audioDescription`` (``Boolean``): Whether the track is an audio
    description (for the visually impaired or not).

  - ``dub`` (``Boolean|undefined``): If set to `true`, this audio track is a
    "dub", meaning it was recored in another language than the original.
    If set to `false`, we know that this audio track is in an original language.
    This property is `undefined` if we do not known whether it is in an original
    language.

      seconds.

    - ``width`` (``Number|undefined``): The width of video, in pixels.

    - ``height`` (``Number|undefined``): The height of video, in pixels.

    - ``codec`` (``string|undefined``): The codec given in standard MIME type
      format.

    - ``frameRate`` (``string|undefined``): The video framerate.

Triggered when the currently available text tracks change (e.g.: at the
beginning of the content, when period changes...).

The array emitted contains object describing each available text track:

  - ``id`` (``string``): The id used to identify the track. Use it for
    setting the track via ``setTextTrack``.

<a name="events-bitrateEstimationChange"></a>
### bitrateEstimationChange ####################################################

_payload type_: ``Object``

---

:warning: This event is not sent in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](./loadVideo_options.md#prop-transport)).

---

Information about the last bitrate estimation performed, by type of buffer
(``audio``, ``video`` etc.).

Note that this event is sent only if the corresponding buffer type has multiple
[Representations](../terms.md#representation) for the given content (as bitrate
estimations are only useful in that case).

The payload is an object with the following properties:

  - ``type`` (``string``): The buffer type

  - ``bitrate`` (``Number``): The last estimated bandwidth for this buffer type,
    in bits per seconds.
    This bitrate is smoothed by doing a (complex) mean on an extended period of
    time, so it often does not link directly to the current calculated bitrate.



<a name="events-warning"></a>
### warning ####################################################################

_payload type_: ``Error``

Triggered each time a non-fatal (for content playback) error happened.

The payload is the corresponding error. See [the Player Error
documentation](./errors.md) for more information.


<a name="events-error"></a>
### error ######################################################################

_payload type_: ``Error``

Triggered each time a fatal (for content playback) error happened.

The payload is the corresponding error. See [the Player Error
documentation](./errors.md) for more information.


<a name="events-periodChange"></a>
### periodChange ###############################################################

_payload type_: ``Object``

---

:warning: This event is not sent in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](./loadVideo_options.md#prop-transport)).

---

Triggered when the current [Period](../terms.md#period) being seen changes.

The payload is the corresponding Period. See [the Manifest
documentation](./manifest.md#period) for more information.


<a name="events-decipherabilityUpdate"></a>
### decipherabilityUpdate ######################################################

_payload type_: ``Array.<Object>``

---

:warning: This event is not sent in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](./loadVideo_options.md#prop-transport)).

---

Triggered when a or multiple Representation's decipherability status were
updated. Which means either:
  - A Representation is found to be undecipherable (e.g. the key or license
    request is refused)
  - A Representation is found to be decipherable
  - A Representation's decipherability becomes undefined

At this time, this event is only triggered if:
  - the current content is an encrypted content
  - Either the `fallbackOnLastTry` property was set to `true` on a rejected
    `getLicense` call or one of the `fallbackOn` properties was set to true in
    the `keySystems` loadVideo option.

Following this event, the RxPlayer might remove from the current buffers any
data linked to undecipherable Representation(s) (the video might twitch a little
or reload) and update the list of available bitrates.

The payload of this event is an Array of objects, each representating a
Representation whose decipherability's status has been updated.

Each of those objects have the following properties:
  - `representation`: The Representation concerned (more information on its
    structure [in the Manifest documentation](./manifest.md#representation)).
  - `adaptation`: The Adaptation linked to that Representation (more information
    on its structure [in the Manifest documentation](./manifest.md#adaptation)).
  - `period`: The Period linked to that Representation (more information on its
    structure [in the Manifest documentation](./manifest.md#period)).
  - `manifest`: The current Manifest (more information on its structure [in the
    Manifest documentation](./manifest.md#manifest)).

You can then know if any of those Representations are becoming decipherable or
not through their `decipherable` property.


<a name="events-nativeTextTracksChange"></a>
### nativeTextTracksChange #####################################################

---

:warning: This event is deprecated, it will disappear in the next major
release ``v4.0.0`` (see [Deprecated APIs](./deprecated.md)).

---

_payload type_: ``Array.<TextTrackElement>``

---

:warning: This event is not sent in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](./loadVideo_options.md#prop-transport)).

---

Triggered each times a new ``<track>`` element is removed or added to the video
element.

The payload is the array of ``TextTrack`` elements. The RxPlayer will only set
a single ``<track>`` when a text track is set.
