# RxPlayer API

The API documentation is a thorough guide through every feature exposed
by the RxPlayer, in a logical order.

If you are already familiar with the API, you might prefer the conciseness of
[the API reference](../reference/API_Reference.md) instead.

Conversely, If you are very new to the RxPlayer and don't want to dive deep in
the API for the moment, you might want to check [the Getting Started
pages](../Getting_Started/Welcome.md) instead.

<div class="warning">
Only variables and methods defined here are considered as part of the API. Any
other property or method you might find in any other way are not considered as
part of the API and can thus change without notice.
</div>

<div class="note">
As some terms used here might be too foreign or slightly different than the one
youâ€™re used to, we also wrote a list of terms and definitions used by the
RxPlayer <a href="../Getting_Started/Glossary.md">in a "Glossary" page</a>.
