# getVideoLoadedTime

## Description

Returns in seconds the difference between:

- the start of the current contiguous loaded range.
- the end of it.

In other words, this is the duration of the current contiguous range of media
data the player is currently playing:
If we're currently playing at the position at `51` seconds, and there is media
data from the second `40` to the second `60`, then `getVideoLoadedTime()` will
return `20` (`60 - 40`).

`0` if there's no data loaded for the current position.

## Syntax

```js
const loadedTime = player.getVideoLoadedTime();
```

 - **return value** `number`
