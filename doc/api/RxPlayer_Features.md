# RxPlayer Features

## Overview

The RxPlayer has this concept of "features" which are functionalities which may
or may not be included to your build.

This allows to reduce bundle size by not including features you don't use, like
parsers for subtitles formats you don't depend on.

Which features you will need to import will depend on what RxPlayer's build you
rely on;

-   If you import the default RxPlayer build (e.g. through an
    `import RxPlayer from "rx-player` import), you will obtain an RxPlayer with most
    features, which should be sufficient for most use-cases. It already includes the
    following features (description of each available in the next chapter):

    -   `SMOOTH`
    -   `DASH`
    -   `DIRECTFILE`
    -   `EME`
    -   `NATIVE_SRT_PARSER`
    -   `NATIVE_VTT_PARSER`
    -   `NATIVE_TTML_PARSER`
    -   `NATIVE_SAMI_PARSER`
    -   `HTML_SRT_PARSER`
    -   `HTML_VTT_PARSER`
    -   `HTML_TTML_PARSER`
    -   `HTML_SAMI_PARSER`

-   If you import the [RxPlayer's minimal
    build](../Getting_Started/Minimal_Player.md) however (e.g. through an
    `import RxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal` import), you will
    obtain an RxPlayer with no feature by default.
    In that case, you will probably need to add the features you want.

## `addFeatures` static method

New features can be added by calling the [`addFeatures` static
method](../api/RxPlayer_Features.md):
```js
import RxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import { DASH } from "rx-player/features";

RxPlayer.addFeatures([DASH]);
```

## Features list

Features, which are variables imported from the `"rx-player/features"` path,
are all objects declared in upper-case.

Here is the anotated exhaustive list (notes are at the bottom of the table):

| Feature                     | Description of the feature                                |

| `SMOOTH`                    | Enable Smooth streaming (HSS) playback                    |
| `DASH` [1]                  | Enable DASH playback using a JavaScript-based MPD parser  |
| `DIRECTFILE`                | Enable playback of "directfile" contents                  |
| `EME`                       | Enable playback of encrypted contents                     |

| `LOCAL_MANIFEST` [4]        | Enable playback of "local" contents                       |
| `METAPLAYLIST` [4]          | Enable playback of "metaplaylist" contents                |
| `NATIVE_TEXT_BUFFER` [5]    | (Deprecated) Base for the `"native"` `textTrackMode`.     |
| `HTML_TEXT_BUFFER` [5]      | (Deprecated) Base for the `"html"` `textTrackMode`.       |

---

**Notes**:

**[1]**: In cases where both the `DASH` and `DASH_WASM` features are added
(which are both parsers for DASH contents), the RxPlayer will default using the
WebAssembly parser (provided by `DASH_WASM`) and fallback on the JavaScript
parser (provided by `DASH`) when it cannot do so.

**[2]**: The `"native"` and `"html"` `textTrackMode` are options set when
loading a new content through the [`loadVideo` method](../api/Loading_a_Content.md).
To help you choose between those two:
  - The `"native"` mode relies on HTMLTrackElement (`<track>` tags) to display
    subtitles.
    This does not need any setup but may lead to poorly stylized subtitles.
    You may rely on this if you don't need advanced subtitles stylization.
  - The `"html"` mode relies on regular HTMLElement (like `<div>` and such) to
    display subtitles.
    It allows more powerful stylization but will need a parent
    `textTrackElement` to also be provided on that same `loadVideo` call (as
    documented [in the corresponding API documentation
    page](../api/Loading_a_Content.md).


**[3]**: Those features are experimental. They should be imported from
`rx-player/experimental/features`.

**[4]**: The `DASH_WASM` feature has its own setup, detailed in the
[corresponding documentation page](../api/Miscellaneous/DASH_WASM_Parser.md).

**[5]**: Both the `NATIVE_TEXT_BUFFER` and `HTML_TEXT_BUFFER` features are
deprecated. They are already implicitly imported when parsing any of the
corresponding text parsers.

## Examples

To help you choose your features, are some examples that represents common
usecases.

### unencrypted DASH contents with native webVTT subtitles

```js
import RxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import {
    DASH,
    NATIVE_VTT_PARSER,
} from "rx-player/features";

RxPlayer.addFeatures([DASH, NATIVE_VTT_PARSER]);
```

## possibly-encrypted DASH contents with HMTL webVTT and TTML subtitles

```js
import RxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import {
    DASH,
    EME,
    HTML_VTT_PARSER,
    HTML_HTML_PARSER,
} from "rx-player/features";

RxPlayer.addFeatures([
    DASH,
    EME,
    HTML_VTT_PARSER,
    HTML_TTML_PARSER,
]);
```
## Building with environment variables (not recommended)

### How it works

If you don't want to or can't rely on tree shaking for your use-case but still
would like to remove features you don't want, you can also build yourself an
RxPlayer while only enabling specific features through environment variables.
The code related to the unwanted features should be removed when the final code
is minified (as the corresponding code is made unreachable).

To be able to do this, you will need to:
  1. pull the RxPlayer's repository (for example, through a `git clone`)
  2. install its dependencies (for example by calling `npm install` in that
     repository),
  3. run its bundling script (`npm run build:min`) with the right environment
     variables.

To avoid any conflict with other environment variables, they all are named
`RXP_<FEATURE-NAME>`.

For example, the following will remove all code related to Microsoft Smooth
Streaming from the build:

```sh
RXP_SMOOTH=false npm run build:min
```

### List of environment variables

#### RXP_SMOOTH

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to HSS streaming will be
ignored during a build.

#### RXP_DASH

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to DASH streaming will be
ignored during a build.

#### RXP_DIRECTFILE

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to directfile streaming
will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_LOCAL_MANIFEST

False by default. If set to "true", all code relative to the "local" transport
(to be able to play content offline for example) will be included during a
build.

#### RXP_METAPLAYLIST

False by default. If set to "true", all code relative to metaplaylist streaming
will be included during a build.

#### RXP_DEBUG_ELEMENT

False by default. If set to "true", the method RxPlayer's `createDebugElement`
method will be callable.

#### RXP_EME

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to encrypted contents will
be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_NATIVE_TTML

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to TTML parsing for native
text tracks will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_NATIVE_SAMI

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to SAMI parsing for native
text tracks will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_NATIVE_VTT

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to VTT parsing for native
text tracks will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_NATIVE_SRT

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to SRT parsing for native
text tracks will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_HTML_TTML

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to TTML parsing for html
text tracks [1] will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_HTML_SAMI

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to SAMI parsing for html
text tracks [1] will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_HTML_VTT

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to VTT parsing for html
text tracks [1] will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_HTML_SRT

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to SRT parsing for html
text tracks [1] will be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_BIF_PARSER

True by default. If set to "false", all code relative to BIF image parsing will
be ignored during a build.

#### RXP_BAREBONE

If set to true, no feature is activated by default and all other environment
variables are considered as false by default (unless set).

For example, to only activate DASH, you could do:

```sh
RXP_BAREBONE=true RXP_DASH=true npm run build:min
```

#### RXP_ENV

Either "production" or "development". "production" as a default.
In the "development" case:

- logs will be activated
- the code will be less tolerant towards unwanted behavior
- the code will be less optimized

**Notes**:

DOM element instead of a `<track>` (the latter here being called "native") tag
for a richer formatting.
