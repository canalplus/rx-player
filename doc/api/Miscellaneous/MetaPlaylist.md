# MetaPlaylist v0.1

## Overview

The `MetaPlaylist` is a file allowing to define a content composed of multiple
DASH or Smooth contents played one after another.

It allows advanced use cases for an extremely low cost for the server
infrastructure, the main one being creating a linear (live) contents from
multiple non-linear (VOD) ones, without touching the original contents.

You can also construct a new non-linear contents as a concatenation of multiple
non-linear contents put one after the other. This method allows for example for
a completely smooth streaming between multiple programs (e.g. when
binge-watching a serie).

## Differences with plain DASH contents

The same result could be approximated with some advanced DASH features, but the
MetaPlaylist has several advantages. Some of them are:

- it supports DASH and HSS contents (technically HLS would also be possible)
  without modifying the original MPD/Manifest nor segments.

- the Manifest/MPD/Playlist corresponding to the original contents can
  be lazy-loaded (loaded only when the content will play).

  This is also possible in DASH with a feature called XLinks but it's not
  always doable on the client-side, depending on the other elements present in
  that MPD.

  A MetaPlaylist file is much more strict in this regard.

  This is still a work-in-progress.

- it's a format especially intended to be a concatenation of multiple
  contents to be played on the web.

  As such, advanced features such as declaring segments before they
  should be played or avoiding many customers doing the same manifest
  request at the exact same time are much easier to implement.

- this file rarely needs to be updated, improving the caching of this
  ressource.

- its format is very simple and in JSON, which is easy to integrate with
  JavaScript codebases. The file can even be very easily generated directly on
  the client's page. This paves the way for contents personalized to a single
  customer.

- Digital right management is also much more flexible than with a DASH MPD.
  For example, different license servers for different contents could be
  integrated. This is still a work-in-progress.

- the specification is simple, try to allow no interpretation and is strict on
  what is permitted.

- All its features have been tested on web applications, meaning that you have
  the guarantee everything will work on most MSE-compatible browsers, even
  IE11.

## Structure of a MetaPlaylist

A MetaPlaylist file is a simple JSON file.

To jump into it right away, let me introduce some examples.

For a VOD content:

```json
{
  "type": "MPL",
  "version": "0.1",
  "contents": [
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/DASH/first_content.mpd",
      "startTime": 0,
      "endTime": 100.38,
      "transport": "dash"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/DASH/second_content.Manifest",
      "startTime": 100.38,
      "endTime": 372,
      "transport": "smooth"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/Smooth/third_content.mpd",
      "startTime": 372,
      "endTime": 450.787,
      "transport": "dash"
    }
  ]
}
```

For a live content:

```json
{
  "type": "MPL",
  "version": "0.1",
  "dynamic": true,
  "pollInterval": 5,
  "contents": [
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/DASH/content.mpd",
      "startTime": 1545845950.176,
      "endTime": 1545845985.571,
      "transport": "dash"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/other/DASH/content.mpd",
      "startTime": 1545845985.571,
      "endTime": 1545845998.71,
      "transport": "dash"
    },
    {
      "url": "http://url.to.some/Smooth/content.Manifest",
      "startTime": 1545845998.71,
      "endTime": 1545845117,
      "transport": "smooth"
    }
  ]
}
```

You may already have a basic understanding of it how works.
Let's define nonetheless every property in that JSON file.

### the header

What I call the "header" here is roughly all root properties but "contents".

Here is an exhaustive list of what you should put there:

- type (`string`): should always be equal to `"MPL"`, for "MetaPlayList".

  The purpose of this value is to facilitate the checks a player might want to
  perform to verify that it is handling a MetaPlaylist file.
  The end goal would be for example to improve error reporting for very
  frequent mistakes like not providing the URL of the right content.

- version (`string`): version of the MetaPlaylist file. Separated in two parts
  by a point ('.').

  The first part indicates the major version. If its number is higher than
  what the client presently manage, the client should not try to read that
  file.

  The last part indicates the minor version:
  A new feature or fix have been added but its support is not needed by a
  client (a client written for the `1.0` version can be used even for the
  `1.99` version).

  Please note that there is an exception for `0.x` versions, where each minor
  versions could have a breaking change (as it is in that case considered an
  experimental format).

  At the moment, there is only one version the version `"0.1"`. Thus, this is
  what you have to set in your JSON if you integrate this specification.

- dynamic (`boolean`|`undefined`): If `true`, the MetaPlaylist file is not
  finished, and might need to be updated. If `false`, the MetaPlaylist could
  still need to be updated but its current content indicates a finished
  content: A player should end when the end of the last content has been
  reached.

  This property is not mandatory and as such can be omitted. By default, it is
  considered as not dynamic (so `false`).

- pollInterval (`number`|`undefined`): If not set or set to a negative number,
  the MetaPlaylist file does not need to be reloaded.

  If set to a positive number, this is the maximum interval in seconds at
  which the MetaPlaylist file should be fetched from the server (which means
  that the MetaPlaylist could be refreshed more often depending on the current
  conditions).

  This should only be defined for dynamic contents.

  This property is not mandatory and as such can be omitted. By default, it is
  equivalent to `-1` (which means no reload).

### The contents

The contents are all defined as a property called `contents` at the top level of
our MetaPlaylist file.

It is an array of one or multiple objects (an empty `contents` array is not a
valid MetaPlaylist file).

Each of its objects are linked to a single content, here are the exhaustive
list of its properties:

- url (`string`): the URL to the original DASH's MPD or Smooth's Manifest.
  For now, only a subset of such contents is supported, mainly:

  - DASH contents that have their MPD@type set to `"static"`
  - Smooth content that have their `isLive` attribute not set to `true`
    (Simply put, only on-demand contents are supported for the moment).

- startTime (`number`): time, in seconds, at which the beginning of this
  content should be played.
  This will correspond to the start time of the first Period in DASH or the
  first Chunk defined for Smooth content.

- endTime (`number`): time, in seconds, at which the content should end. It
  the original content is longer, it will be finished at that time instead.
  The original content should not be shorter.

- transport (`string`): indicates the original streaming protocol.
  Can be either of those values for now:
  - `"dash"`: the URL points to a DASH's MPD
  - `"smooth"`: the URL points to a Microsoft Smooth Streaming's Manifest.
  - `"metaplaylist"`: Yes, it is possible to put MetaPlaylist files inside
    other MetaPlaylist files!

All those contents should be contiguous (meaning that the `endTime` of one
should be the same value than the `startTime` of the following one).

## How to actually play a MetaPlaylist content

### Importing the METAPLAYLIST feature

The `"METAPLAYLIST"` feature is not included in the default RxPlayer build.

You will need to import the `LOCAL_MANIFEST` experimental feature:
```js
// Import the RxPlayer
// (here through the "minimal" build, though it doesn't change for other builds)
import RxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";

// Import the `METAPLAYLIST` feature
import { METAPLAYLIST } from "rx-player/experimental/features";

RxPlayer.addFeatures([METAPLAYLIST]);
```

More information on features [in the corresponding documentation
page](../RxPlayer_Features.md).

### Loading a MetaPlaylist content

A MetaPlaylist content can simply be played by setting a `"metaplaylist"`
transport in `loadVideo`:

```js
player.loadVideo({
  url: "http://www.example.com/metaplaylist.json",
  transport: "metaplaylist",
});
```

If you declare locally your MetaPlaylist file and do not want to set a URL for
it, you can serve directly the file through the use of a Manifest Loader:

```js
player.loadVideo({
  transport: "metaplaylist",
  transportOptions: {
    // Note: `_url` here will be `undefined`
    manifestLoader(_url, callbacks) {
      // where `myMetaPlaylistObject` is the MetaPlaylist in either Object or
      // String form
      callbacks.resolve({ data: myMetaPlaylistObject });
    },
  },
});
```

More infos on the `manifestLoader` can be found
[here](./plugins.md#manifestLoader).

### Defining an initial position for a dynamic MetaPlaylist

As already explained, a MetaPlaylist can either be dynamic or static.

For calculating the initial position of those contents, the RxPlayer will obey
[the same rules than for other contents](./Initial_Position.md).

As such, dynamic MetaPlaylist contents will by default start just before the end
of the last defined content which might not be what you want.

In those cases, you can make usage of the `serverSyncInfos` transport options
when calling `loadVideo` to indicate the current time and construct the
MetaPlaylist by using unix time for each content's `startTime` and `endTime`.

The `serverSyncInfos` option is explained [in the `transportOptions`
documentation](../Loading_a_Content.md#transportoptions).

For example, if you trust the user's system clock to indicate the current live
time (in most cases this is risky however), you can use the `Date.now()` api:

```js
const serverSyncInfos = {
  serverTimestamp: Date.now(),
  clientTime: performance.now(),
};

player.loadVideo({
  transport: "metaplaylist",
  url: "https://www.example.com/metaplaylist",
  transportOptions: { serverSyncInfos },
});
```
