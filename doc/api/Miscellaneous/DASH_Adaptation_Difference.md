# Differences between DASH' AdaptationSets and the rx-player "Adaptation"

The RxPlayer defines an `Adaptation` object (also sometimes called `Track`) which follow
as close as possible the concept of the `AdaptationSet` in the DASH protocol.

However, to answer practically to some of the features allowed by DASH while still
respecting the [DASH-IF "IOP"](https://dashif.org/guidelines/), we had to take some
(minor) freedom with our interpretation of it.

## Merging of multiple AdaptationSets into a single Adaptation

The main difference is that all similar `AdaptationSet` which are marked as "seamlessly
switchable" between one another are merged into a single `Adaptation` in the player.

### Why do we do that

This "switchable" concept is for example used in cases were multiple encryption keys are
present for different `Representation` (e.g. due to limitations coming from right
holders).

The problem is that the DASH-IF tells us that all `Representation` in a given
`AdaptationSet` have to use the same license. This means that in the aforementioned case,
the concerned `Representation` have to be divided into multiple `AdaptationSet`. In a
player, different `AdaptationSet` means different "tracks" and thus a player won't try to
automatically switch between them.

This means that our adaptive algorithm won't be able to set the right quality and that the
library user would have to manually manage that instead.

Fortunately, the DASH-IF IOP planned a work-around for that kind of situation: To allow a
player to seamlessly switch between multiple `AdaptationSets`, the DASH-IF allows a
specific node, called `SupplementalProperty` to be added as children of the concerned
`AdaptationSet`s (with a specific value).

However, this brings another set of issues in the rx-player, where this separation would
lead to an excessively complicated API.

### What do we do

We thus decided to "merge" the `AdaptationSet`s into a single `Adaptation` if all those
conditions are filled:

- they both support seamless-switching between one-another (i.e. they both contain a
  `SupplementalProperty` node with the right values)

- they represent the same type of content ("audio", "video" or "text")

- they are of the same language, if one (letter-for-letter in the manifest)

- they have the same accessibility information (e.g. both are closed captions or audio
  description for the visually impaired).

If any of these conditions is not filled, the concerned `AdaptationSet`s stay separated
and the player will not try to switch between them.
