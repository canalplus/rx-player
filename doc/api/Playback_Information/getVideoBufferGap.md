# getVideoBufferGap

## Description

Returns in seconds the difference between:

- the current time.
- the end of the current contiguous loaded range.

In other words, this is the amount of seconds left in the buffer before the end of the
current contiguous range of media data. If we're currently playing at the position at `51`
seconds, and there is media data from the second `40` to the second `60`, then
`getVideoPlayedTime()` will return `9` (`60 - 51`).

## Syntax

```js
const bufferGap = player.getVideoBufferGap();
```

- **return value** `number`
