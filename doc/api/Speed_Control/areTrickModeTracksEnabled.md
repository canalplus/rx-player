# areTrickModeTracksEnabled

## Description

Returns `true` if trickmode playback is active (it is usually enabled through the
`setPlaybackRate` method), which means that the RxPlayer selects "trickmode" video tracks
in priority.

Returns `false` in other cases.

Note that this doesn't mean that the player is currently playing a trickmode track nor
that it is even playing a content, only that it selects trickmode tracks in priority.

To switch on or off this mode, you can use the `setPlaybackRate` method.

## Syntax

```js
const areEnabled = player.areTrickModeTracksEnabled();
```

- **return value** `boolean`
