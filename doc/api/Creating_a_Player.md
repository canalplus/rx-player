# Creating a RxPlayer

## Instantiation

Instantiating a new RxPlayer is necessary before being able to load a content.
Doing so is straightforward:
```js
import RxPlayer from "rx-player";
const player = new RxPlayer(options);
```

## Player options

Player options are options given to the player on instantiation.

It's an object with multiple properties. None of them are mandatory.
For most usecase though, you might want to set at least the associated media
element via the `videoElement` property.

### videoElement

_type_: `HTMLMediaElement|undefined`

The media element the player will use.

Note that despite what its name suggests, this can be a `<video>` or an
`<audio>` element.

```js
// Instantiate the player with the first video element in the DOM
const player = new Player({
  videoElement: document.getElementsByTagName("VIDEO")[0],
});
```

If not defined, a `<video>` element will be created without being inserted in
the document. You will have to do it yourself through the `getVideoElement`
method to add it yourself:

```js
const player = new Player();

const videoElement = player.getVideoElement();
document.body.appendChild(videoElement);
```

### baseBandwidth

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `0`

The initial value used for bandwidth calculations, in bits per seconds.

The RxPlayer will base itself on this value initially before estimating it
itself.
You can set this value either if you have a rough-enough idea of the user's
current bandwidth and/or if you prefer to start loading specific media qualities
initially.

For example, to set an initial bandwidth of 700 kilobits per seconds, you can
set:
```js
const player = new Player({
  baseBandwidth: 700000,
});
```

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### minVideoBitrate

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `0`

Minimum video bitrate reachable through adaptive streaming.

When the quality is chosen through adaptive streaming (i.e., not enforced
manually through APIs such as `lockVideoRepresentations`), the player will
never switch to a video quality with a bitrate lower than that value.

The exception being when no quality has a higher bitrate, in which case the
maximum quality will always be chosen instead.

For example, if you want that video qualities chosen automatically never have
a bitrate lower than 100 kilobits per second you can call:

```js
const player = new Player({
  minVideoBitrate: 100000,
});
```

Any limit can be removed just by setting that value to `0`:

```js
// remove video bitrate lower limit
player.setMinVideoBitrate(0);
```

You can update this limit at any moment with the `setMinVideoBitrate` API
call.

Note that this only affects adaptive strategies. Forcing the quality manually
(by calling `lockVideoRepresentations`) bypasses this limit completely.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### minAudioBitrate

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `0`

Minimum audio bitrate reachable through adaptive streaming.

When the quality is chosen through adaptive streaming (i.e., not enforced
manually through APIs such as `lockAudioRepresentations`), the player will never
switch to an audio quality with a bitrate higher than that value.

The exception being when no quality has a higher bitrate, in which case the
minimum quality will always be chosen instead.

For example, if you want that audio qualities chosen automatically never have
a bitrate higher than 100 kilobits per second you can call:

```js
const player = new Player({
  minAudioBitrate: 100000,
});
```

Any limit can be removed just by setting that value to `0`:

```js
// remove audio bitrate lower limit
player.setMinAudioBitrate(0);
```

You can update this limit at any moment with the `setMinAudioBitrate` API
call.

Note that this only affects adaptive strategies. Forcing the quality manually
(by calling `lockAudioRepresentations`) bypasses this limit completely.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### wantedBufferAhead

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `30`

Set the default buffering goal, as a duration ahead of the current position, in
seconds.

Once this size of buffer is reached, the player won't try to download new
segments anymore.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### maxVideoBufferSize

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `Infinity`

Set the maximum size the video buffer can take in the memory, in kilobytes (kb).
Once this value is reached, the player won't try to download new video
segments anymore. The limit is approximative as it's based on internal estimation.

<div class="warning">
The internal checks of the RxPlayer is based on an estimation of what the RxPlayer think
is currently buffered and an estimation of the size of the next segments.
</div>

<div class="warning">
In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a
href="../Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>),
this method has no effect.
</div>

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effects if we didn't buffer at least <b>MIN_BUFFER_LENGTH</b>
<i>( defaults at 5sec )</i>
</div>

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### maxBufferAhead

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `Infinity`

Set the maximum kept buffer ahead of the current position, in seconds.

Everything superior to that limit (`currentPosition + maxBufferAhead`) will
be automatically garbage collected.

This feature is not necessary as the browser should by default correctly
remove old segments from memory if/when the memory is scarce.

However on some custom targets, or just to better control the memory footprint
of the player, you might want to set this limit.

Its default value, `Infinity`, will remove this limit and just let the browser
do this job instead.

The minimum value between this one and the one returned by
`getWantedBufferAhead` will be considered when downloading new segments.

<div class="warning">
Bear in mind that a too-low configuration there (e.g. inferior to
`10`) might prevent the browser to play the content at all.
</div>

You can update that limit at any time through the
[setMaxBufferAhead](./Buffer_Control/setMaxBufferAhead.md) method.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### maxBufferBehind

_type_: `Number|undefined`

_defaults_: `Infinity`

Set the maximum kept buffer before the current position, in seconds.

Everything before that limit (`currentPosition - maxBufferBehind`) will be
automatically garbage collected.

This feature is not necessary as the browser should by default correctly
remove old segments from memory if/when the memory is scarce.

However on some custom targets, or just to better control the memory footprint
of the player, you might want to set this limit.

Its default value, `Infinity`, will remove this limit and just let the browser
do this job instead.

You can update that limit at any time through the
[setMaxBufferBehind](./Buffer_Control/setMaxBufferBehind.md) method.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded in <i>Directfile</i>
mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
</div>

### limitVideoWidth

_type_: `Boolean`

_defaults_: `false`

With this feature, the possible video
[Representations](../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#representation) considered are
filtered by width:

The maximum width considered is the closest superior or equal to the video
element's width.

This is done because the other, "superior" Representations will not have any
difference in glossary of pixels (as in most case, the display limits the maximum
resolution displayable). It thus save bandwidth with no visible difference.

To activate this feature, set it to `true`.

```js
const player = Player({
  limitVideoWidth: true,
});
```

For some reasons (displaying directly a good quality when switching to
fullscreen, specific environments), you might not want to activate this limit.

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded :

- In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
- On Firefox browsers (version >= 67) : We can't know if the Picture-In-Picture
  feature or window is enabled and we can't know PIP window size. Thus we can't
  rely on video element size attributes, that may not reflect the real video size
  when PIP is enabled.

</div>

### throttleVideoBitrateWhenHidden

_type_: `Boolean`

_defaults_: `false`

The player has a specific feature which throttle the video to the minimum
bitrate when the current video element is considered hidden (e.g. the containing
page is hidden and the Picture-In-Picture mode is disabled) for more than a
minute.

To activate this feature, set it to `true`.

```js
const player = Player({
  throttleVideoBitrateWhenHidden: true,
});
```

<div class="warning">
This option will have no effect for contents loaded :

- In <i>DirectFile</i> mode (see <a href="./Loading_a_Content.md#transport">loadVideo options</a>).
- On Firefox browsers (version >= 67) : We can't know if the Picture-In-Picture
  feature or window is enabled. Thus we can't rely on document hiddenness
  attributes, as the video may be visible, through the PIP window.
