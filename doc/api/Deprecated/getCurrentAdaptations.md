# getCurrentAdaptations

<div class="warning">
This option is deprecated, it will disappear in the next major release
`v4.0.0` (see <a href="../Miscellaneous/Deprecated_APIs.md">Deprecated
APIs</a>).
</div>

## Description

Returns the [Adaptations](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#adaptation) being
loaded per type if a [Manifest](../../Getting_Started/Glossary.md#manifest) is
loaded. The returned object will have at most a key for each type ("video",
"audio", "text" and "image") which will each contain an array of Adaptation
Objects.

The Adaptation object structure is relatively complex and is described in the
[Manifest Object structure page](../Miscellaneous/Manifest_Object.md#structure-of-an-adaptation-object).

`null` if the current Adaptations are not known yet.

`null` in _DirectFile_ mode (see [loadVideo
options](../Loading_a_Content.md#transport)).

## Syntax

```js
const adaptations = player.getCurrentAdaptations();
```

  - **return value** `Object|null`: The current Adaptation objects, per type.
    `null` if not known.
