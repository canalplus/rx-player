# mute

## Description

Mute the audio volume.

It can then be un-muted through [the unMute method](./unMute.md).

As the volume is not dependent on a single content (it is persistent), this method can
also be called when no content is playing.

## Syntax

```js
player.mute();
```

## Example

```js
// mute the current volume
player.mute();
```
