<h1>The Stream</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Even if the API is the front-facing block of code in the Rx-player, the Stream
is the part of the code actually doing most logic behind playing a content.</p>
<p>The API is just a higher, object-oriented, layer for easier library interactions.</p>
<p>Its code is written in the <code>src/core/stream</code> directory. More specifically,
all needed code should be exported by its &#x201C;index file&#x201D;
<code>src/core/stream/index.ts</code>.</p>
<p>Every times you&#x2019;re calling the API to load a new video, the Stream function is
called by it with a handful of arguments.</p>
<p>The Stream does then the major part of the job and communicate back its progress
to the API through events.</p>
<pre><code>                 +-----------+
 1. LOAD VIDEO   |           |      2. CALLS
---------------&gt; |    API    | -------------------+
                 |           |                    |
                 +-----------+                    |
                       ^                          v
                       |                    +--------------+
                       |   3. EMIT EVENTS   |              |

                                            +--------------+
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, the job of the Stream is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>initialize the content (creating the MediaSource and SourceBuffers,
downloading the manifest)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect most core parts of the player together, such as adaptive
streaming management, segment downloads, DRMs&#x2026;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, during the various events happening on content playback, the Stream
will create / destroy / update various player blocks. Such example of blocks
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adaptive streaming management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DRM management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffer management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manifest refreshing management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#x2026;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-Usage"></a></p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Concretely, the Stream is a function which returns an Observable.
This Observable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>will automatically load the described content on subscription</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will automatically stop and clean-up infos related to the content on
unsubscription</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate on various streaming events through emitted notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>throw in the case of a fatal error (error interruption playback)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="subchapter-Communication%20between%20the%20API%20and%20the%20Stream"></a></p>
<h3>Communication between the API and the Stream</h3>
<p>Objects emitted by the Observable is the only way the Stream should be able to
communicate with the API.</p>
<p>The API is then able to communicate back to the Stream, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by Observable provided by the API as arguments when the Stream function was
called</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by emitting through Subject provided by the Stream, as a payload of one of
its event</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, there is three ways the API and Stream can communicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>API -&gt; Stream: When the Stream function is called (so a single time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stream -&gt; API: Through events emitted by the returned Observable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API -&gt; Stream: Through Observables/Subjects the Stream is in possession of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="subchapter-Emitted%20Events"></a></p>
<h3>Emitted Events</h3>
<p>Events allows the Stream to reports milestones of the content playback, such as
when the content has been loaded.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also a way for the Stream to communicate informations about the content and
give some controls to the user.</p>
<p>For example, as available audio languages are only known after the manifest has
been downloaded and parsed, and as it is most of all a user preference, the
Stream can emit to the API RxJS Subjects allowing the API to &#x201C;choose&#x201D; at any
time the wanted language.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Building%20blocks"></a></p>
<h2>Building blocks</h2>
<p>The Stream put in relation multiple part of the code to allow a qualitative
playback experience.</p>
<p>Multiple of those building bricks are considered as part of the Stream.</p>
<p>Among them, you can find:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="buffer_handler.html">the Buffer Handler</a></strong></p>
<p>Create/destroy the Buffer and SourceBuffers needed, that will be used to
push new media segments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="buffer_garbage_collector.html">the Buffer Garbage Collector</a></strong></p>
<p>Perform manual garbage collection on SourceBuffers periodically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="segment_bookkeeper.html">the Segment Bookkeeper</a></strong></p>
<p>Keep track of the informations of every segments currently present in the
buffer, e.g. to know which part of the buffer are linked to which
quality/language etc.</p>
<p>Also useful to know when segments have automatically been garbage-collected
by the browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="speed_manager.html">the Speed Manager</a></strong></p>
<p>Handle playback rate management. To pause when we should build buffer, for
example, and speed-up/lower-up the playback rate when the user ask for this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the Stalling Manager</strong></p>
<p>Try to un-stall the player when it does so.</p>
</li>
</ul>
