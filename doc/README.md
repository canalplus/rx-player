# RxPlayer Documentation

Welcome to the RxPlayer documentation.

This directory contains all available information on how to use the RxPlayer.
Documentation files in this directory are all Markdown files compatible to the
CommonMark specification.

Moreover, the RxPlayer's doc generator is able to use those files and the
`.docConfig.json` files in the different folders to generate the official HTML
documentation pages directly from those same Markdown files, with no
modification.

The different directories link to different documentation categories:

- `api/`: link to the complete API documentation

- `Getting_Started/`: link to the tutorials and resource useful when starting
  to use the RxPlayer

- `reference/`: link to the API reference, which lists briefly and in a single
  page all available API.

- `static/`: contains images and resources Markdown files may link to.
  Some of those resources may only be used for the HTML documentation
  generation.
