<h1>SegmentBookkeeper</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The SegmentBookkeeper is a class which registers informations about every
segments currently present in a SourceBuffer.
The RxPlayer&#x2019;s Stream creates one of them for each SourceBuffer created.</p>
<p>This helps Buffers to avoid re-downloading segments unnecessarily and know when
old one have been garbage collected.
For example, we could decide not to re-download a segment in any of the
following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same segment is already completely present in the SourceBuffer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same segment is partially present in the SourceBuffer (read: a part has
been removed or garbage collected), but enough is still there for what we
want to play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another segment is in the SourceBuffer at the wanted time, but it is the
same content in a better or samey quality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, we need to download the segment in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No segment has been pushed at the given time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed, but at a lower quality than what we currently
want</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed at a sufficient quality, but we miss to much of it
for our needs (too much has been garbage collected, removed or the segment
is just too short).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed but is not exactly the content we want
(example: it is in another language)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the SegmentBookkeeper, we can infer on which situation we are at any time.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The SegmentBookkeeper is merely a &#x201C;Store&#x201D;, meaning it will just store and
process the data you give to it, without searching for the information itself.</p>
<p>It contains in its state an array, the <em>inventory</em>, which stores every segments
which should be present in the SourceBuffer in a chronological order.</p>
<p>To construct this inventory, two methods can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one to add informations about a new segment, which should have been pushed
to the SourceBuffer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one to synchronize the currently pushed segments with what the real
SourceBuffer says it has buffered</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After calling the synchronization one, you should be able to tell which parts of
which segments are currently <em>living</em> in your SourceBuffer.</p>
