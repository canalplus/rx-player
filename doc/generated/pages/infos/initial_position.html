<h1>At what position does the RxPlayer start a content</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>When you give it a content to load, the RxPlayer has to set at one point the
starting playback position.</p>
<p>This documentation page explain how that position is calculated.</p>
<p>Basically, we can be in one of those four different situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a valid <code>startAt</code> option has been set to <code>loadVideo</code>, in which case we use
it to define the initial position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no <code>startAt</code> option has been set and we’re playing a VoD content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no <code>startAt</code> option has been set and we’re playing a live content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no <code>startAt</code> option has been set and we’re playing a directfile content.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-About%20the%20minimum%20and%20maximum%20position"></a></p>
<h2>About the minimum and maximum position</h2>
<p>Regardless of your current situation, the minimum and maximum position of the
content might be calculated and used when defining that starting position.</p>
<p>Those positions are inferred directly from the Manifest (when not playing a
directfile content).
Most Manifests declare every segments currently available. In that case, we can
simply use the start of the first announced segment as a minimum position and the
end of the last one as a maximum.</p>
<p>In some other Manifest files, segment availability is not clearly announced.
In those cases, the minimum and maximum positions use other properties declared
in the Manifest, often by making usage of a synchronized clock between the
client and the server.</p>
<p>For “directfile” contents, we directly interrogate the browser to obtain the
duration of the content. The minimum position here is always inferred to be <code>0</code>
(for the moment at least).</p>
<p><a name="chapter-When%20a%20startAt%20option%20has%20been%20set"></a></p>
<h2>When a startAt option has been set</h2>
<p>You can define yourself the start position at which we should play. This is
configurable thanks to the startAt option, documented
<a href="../api/loadVideo_options.html#prop-startAt">here in the API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Please note however that there is a catch: every of the possible values you
will set will be “bounded” to the maximum and minimum position actually detected
for the content.</p>
<p>This means that if your startAt indicate that we should start at a position of
<code>10</code> seconds but the content starts at <code>15</code> seconds, we will actually start
at <code>15</code> seconds instead.</p>
<p>You can check at which position we actually loaded when the player’s state
(accessible either through the <code>getPlayerState</code> method or through the
<code>playerStateChanged</code> event) changed to <code>"LOADED"</code>.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-When%20no%20startAt%20option%20has%20been%20set%20and%20we're%20playing%20a%20VoD%20content"></a></p>
<h2>When no startAt option has been set and we’re playing a VoD content</h2>
<p>For VoD contents, we will just start to play at the minimum detected position in
the Manifest.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-When%20no%20startAt%20option%20has%20been%20set%20and%20we're%20playing%20a%20live%20content"></a></p>
<h2>When no startAt option has been set and we’re playing a live content</h2>
<p>For live contents, we have here three cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case where we have a clock synchronization mechanism with the
server[1] and if the current date can be seeked to (i.e. segments are
available for that position), we will try to play close to[2] that date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if either we do not have a clock synchronization mechanism[1] or if we have
one but no segment is defined for the current date, we will play close to[2]
the maximum calculated position instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third case, if we do not have any clock synchronization mechanism[1] and if
the Manifest does not announce clearly a maximum position, we will use the
system clock and play close to[2] that time instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[1] We can obtain a synchronized clock allowing us to to know which content
should be broadcasted at which time by either of those means:</p>
<ul>
<li>the Manifest document defines one (e.g. <code>UTCTiming</code> elements for DASH
contents).</li>
<li>One was provided to <code>loadVideo</code> thanks to the <code>serverSyncInfos</code> transport
option <a href="../api/loadVideo_options.html#prop-transportOptions">see loadVideo
documentation</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>[2] I wrote “close to” in every cases as we might substract some seconds from
that value. How much we might do, depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the manifest suggest us a delay relative to the live, in which case we
apply it</li>
<li>if not, we set it to the default: <code>10</code> seconds</li>
</ul>

<h2>When no startAt option has been set and we’re playing a directfile content</h2>
<p>For directfile contents, we for now just start at <code>0</code> if no <code>startAt</code> is
defined.</p>
