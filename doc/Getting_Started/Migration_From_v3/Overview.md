# Migration guide: from v3.x.x to v4.0.0

## Overview

The `v4.0.0` release is a major RxPlayer release.

It deeply changes some aspects of the RxPlayer API, particularly relative to tracks and
quality selection.

Though we succeeded to maintain API compatibility for more than 6 years despite huge
changes in the OTT media streaming domain, we considered that an API overhaul was now
necessary to better handle the features of the current streaming landscape (normalization
of multi-Period contents, multiplication of potential video, audio and text
characteristics, low-latency streaming, Content Steering, MSE-in-worker etc.) as well as
to improve the RxPlayer maintainance by removing old deprecated but burdensome API.

Still, we understand that porting to a new major version of the RxPlayer might not be a
small task, and thus decided to continue maintaining the v3.x.x for some time and
releasing the `v4.0.0` with this complete migration guide.

## Organization of this documentation

The goal of this documentation is not to advertise about new RxPlayer features, it is only
to list all breaking changes and indicate how to replace the corresponding options,
methods and events.

If you want to know what was brought into a `v4.x.x` release instead, you can obtain more
information by looking at release notes, the changelog,
[the API documentation](../../api/Overview.md) and tutorials.

## Important changes

### New player state: `"FREEZING"`

#### The `"FREEZING"` state

A new player state, `"FREEZING"`, has been added.

This state is switched to when playback is not advancing despite not being paused and
despite the player having some buffered media data to play. Generally a brief and
transitory state, there may even be valid and un-worrying reasons behind this state: for
example it may be caused by some minor performance issue after heavy operations like
seeking, or triggered when the player is waiting for the license to be loaded.

Though a `"FREEZING"` state may also be linked to a real content or device issue. The
RxPlayer will use tricks to try to come out of a `"FREEZING"` state if it locks playback
for too long, but if it happens often and/or for long periods of time, it might be a sign
that there some other issues to look for either on the content, on the environment
(device, browser, hardware etc.) or both.

Previously such `"FREEZING"` state was either reported as a `"BUFFERING"` state or not
reported at all (i.e. we would for example be in a `"PLAYING"` state) depending on the
case. As such this new state does not correspond to any new behavior, it just gives more
precision about something that was previously not specifically described.

#### How to handle it

Player states in general are still communicated through the
[`playerStateChange` event](../../api/Player_Events.md#playerstatechange) and
[`getPlayerState`](../../api/Basic_Methods/getPlayerState.md) methods, which you may now
want to update to handle the new `"FREEZING"` case.

For most cases, showing a waiting indicator on top of the video like a spinner, like you
probably already do for the `"BUFFERING"` case, should be sufficient.

```js
rxPlayer.addEventListener("playerStateChange", (state) => {
  switch (state) {
    case "BUFFERING":
    case "FREEZING":
      displaySpinner();
      break;
    // ...
  }
});
```

Some applications might however prefer to report differently such `"FREEZING"` cases, for
example to detect playback issues on some devices.

### RxPlayer behavior when reaching the content's end

The RxPlayer previously automatically stopped the content when its end was reached unless
the (now removed) `stopAtEnd` constructor option was set to `false`.

As a saner default, the RxPlayer now won't stop the content when reaching its end anymore,
if you want to reproduce this behavior, you can simply stop the content when the `"ENDED"`
player state is reached:

```js
rxPlayer.addEventListener("playerStateChange", (state) => {
  if (state === "ENDED") {
    rxPlayer.stop();
  }
});
```

### The `"RELOADING"` state now has to be handled

Brought in the `v3.6.0` (2018), the `"RELOADING"` player state was switched to when the
RxPlayer needed to reset buffers in specific situations. Because just adding a player
state is a breaking change, we were careful to only allow it when specific options were
set.

The RxPlayer may now switch to the `"RELOADING"` state in any situation where it could fix
playback issues, allowing us to more effectively work-around specific bugs.

This means that you now have to make sure that state is considered. You can see more
information on the `"RELOADING"` state
[in the player state page](../../api/Player_States.md#the_reloading_state). Thankfully, it
is now possible to perform more operations under that state, such as switching tracks and
qualities.

### Removal of track preferences API

All methods related to track preferences:

- `setPreferredAudioTracks`
- `setPreferredTextTracks`
- `setPreferedVideoTracks`
- `getPreferredAudioTracks`
- `getPreferredTextTracks`
- `getPreferredVideoTracks`

As well as the following constructor options:

- `preferredAudioTracks`
- `preferredTextTracks`
- `preferredVideoTracks`

Have been removed because their behaviors and more can be replaced by the new track API.

For more information on how to replace them, you can go to the
[preferences pages of the migration guide](./Preferences.md).

### Removal of bitrate control API

All methods related to controlling the current audio and video bitrate:

- `setMinVideoBitrate`
- `setMinAudioBitrate`
- `getMinVideoBitrate`
- `getMinAudioBitrate`
- `setMaxVideoBitrate`
- `setMaxAudioBitrate`
- `getMaxVideoBitrate`
- `getMaxAudioBitrate`
- `setVideoBitrate`
- `setAudioBitrate`
- `getManualVideoBitrate`
- `getManualAudioBitrate`

As well as the following constructor options:

- `minVideoBitrate`
- `minAudioBitrate`
- `maxVideoBitrate`
- `maxAudioBitrate`

Have been removed.

To replace them, we created the much more powerful "Representations locking" family of
methods and options. Documentation on how to do the switch from the old API to the new is
documented in the [Bitrate Selection page of the migration guide](./Bitrate_Selection.md)

## Other modifications

### Constructor options

Constructor options are options given when instantiating a new RxPlayer.

Several of these options have been removed, they are all listed in the
[Constructor Options page](./Constructor_Options.md).

### `loadVideo` options

Several options of the central `loadVideo` method have been updated and removed.

They are all listed in the [`loadVideo` Options page](./loadVideo_Options.md).

### Player events

All updated and removed events are listed in the [Player Events page](./Player_Events.md).

### Player Errors

All updated and removed player errors and warnings are listed in the
[Player Error page](./Player_Errors.md).

### Methods

Several RxPlayer methods were removed, replaced or had their arguments changed. This is
all documented in the [Player Methods page](./Player_Methods.md).

### Types

Several RxPlayer types have been removed and updated. This is all documented in the
[Player Types page](./Player_Types.md).

### Experimental features

The `DASH_WASM` and `DEBUG_ELEMENT` features are now moved as stable features.

This means that what was previously written as:

```js
import { DASH_WASM, DEBUG_ELEMENT } from "rx-player/experimental/features";
```

Should now be written:

```js
import { DASH_WASM, DEBUG_ELEMENT } from "rx-player/features";
```

### Experimental tools

The `parseBifThumbnails` tool is now considered a stable tool.

This means that what was previously written as:

```js
import { parseBifThumbnails } from "rx-player/experimental/tools";
```

Should now be written:

```js
import { parseBifThumbnails } from "rx-player/tools";
```

### Miscellaneous

Other minor changes on which you might have relied are present in the v4.x.x:

- From now, you should not expect Internet Explorer 11 to keep being supported as we won't
  be testing this browser nor officially providing support for it anymore.

  You may however be able contribute if its support is important to you, as long as those
  modifications have a low influence on the code's health.

- It is not possible anymore to use environment variables (like `RXP_DASH`) to bundle a
  personalized build yourself. If you want to have a personalized build, you now have to
  rely on the [mininal RxPlayer](../Minimal_Player.md).

- "Forced" text tracks are now not switched according to audio track preferences because
  the preference API has been removed.

  Instead, the forced text track linked to the default audio track is by default chosen
  and an application can change it at any time.
