# Migration from v3: RxPlayer types

Several of RxPlayer TypeScript types have been removed, renamed or updated.

They are all listed here.

## `IPersistentSessionStorage`

`IPersistentSessionStorage` has been renamed `IPersistentLicenseConfig` to replicate the
renaming of the `licenseStorage` option into the `persistentLicenseConfig` option.

## `ISupplementaryTextTrackOption`

The `ISupplementaryTextTrackOption` type has been removed because the corresponding
`supplementaryTextTracks` option has been removed.

## `ISupplementaryImageTrackOption`

The `ISupplementaryImageTrackOption` type has been removed because the corresponding
`supplementaryImageTracks` option has been removed.

## `IBitrateEstimate`

The `IBitrateEstimate` type has been removed as the corresponding
`bitrateEstimationChange` event has been removed.

## `IManifest` / `IPeriod` / `IAdaptation` / `IRepresentation`

All those types have been removed because corresponding API now return more specialized
types.

## `IRepresentationInfos`

The `IRepresentationInfos` type has been renamed `IRepresentationContext` (the second
argument for the `representationFilter` API).

## `IBifThumbnail` / `IBifObject`

Both types have now to be imported from the
[`parseBifThumbnails`](../../api/Tools/parseBifThumbnails.md) tool's path instead.

## `IExposedSegment`

The `IExposedSegment` type has been removed as no API depends on it anymore.

## `IAudioTrackPreference` / `ITextTrackPreference` / `IVideoTrackPreference`

The `IAudioTrackPreference`, `ITextTrackPreference` and `IVideoTrackPreference` public
types have been removed as the corresponding API do not exist anymore.

## `IDefaultAudioTrackOption` / `IDefaultTextTrackOption`

Both types have been removed because the corresponding `defaultAudioTrack` and
`defaultTextTrack` options also have been removed.
