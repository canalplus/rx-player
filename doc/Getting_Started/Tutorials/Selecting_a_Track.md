# Tutorial: Selecting a track

## The goal of this tutorial

The RxPlayer has an advanced API when it comes to track selection:

You can list, change, enable or disable video audio and text tracks for either what is
currently being played or any other [Period](../Glossary.md#period) in the current
content. Because the RxPlayer's track API tries to be complete and flexible, it can feel
intimidating at first.

This tutorial will help you understand what your options are, why you would use an API
instead of another and how to use them.

## What is a "track"?

We should first agree on what is a track, as a concept. Let's take for example an italian
film presented to an english-speaking audience.

For that film, let's imagine those multiple "audio tracks":

- one being the original audio track, in italian
- one being a dub in the english language
- another in english with accessibility features such as an audio description of what
  visually happens in the film (for example, to give cues of what is happening to the
  visually-impaired).

There also could be multiple "text tracks":

- subtitles in english
- closed-captions in english (for example, for the hearing impaired)

And we could even imagine multiple video tracks:

- one displaying the "regular" film
- another displaying either the same film from a different camera angle (seems far-fetched
  here but let's just pretend we're talking about some kind of experimental film!)

All those will provide to the user a different way to offer the same film. In most cases,
audiom video and text tracks are currently independent and can such be switched in a large
number of combination to give a large number of different experience for what is
effectively the same content.

## Listing the available tracks

### Nominal case: currently played content

#### Using methods

Once the RxPlayer has loaded a content (meaning the RxPlayer is not in the `STOPPED`,
`LOADING` or `RELOADING` [player state](../../api/Player_States.md)) you can begin to ask
it what is the current list of available tracks.

This can be done through three RxPlayer methods:

- [`getAvailableAudioTracks()`](../../api/Track_Selection/getAvailableAudioTracks.md) to
  list audio tracks
- [`getAvailableVideoTracks()`](../../api/Track_Selection/getAvailableVideoTracks.md) to
  list video tracks
- [`getAvailableTextTracks()`](../../api/Track_Selection/getAvailableTextTracks.md) to
  list text tracks

Those methods will all return arrays of objects, each object containing information about
a single track.

It should be noted that the information for an audio track won't be the same than for a
video or a text track. For example, you might be interested by the height and width
available in a video track. Those notions make absolutely no sense for an audio track.

For more information about the structure of the data returned by those methods, you can
refer to their API documentation (a shortcut is available by clicking on the method name).

Note that you can still ask for the current tracks when the RxPlayer does not have loaded
any content (is in the `STOPPED`, `LOADING` or `RELOADING` player state), but you will
most likely only get an empty array in those cases.

##### Examples

Those methods are straightforward, here are some examples of how they can be used:

```js
// Array of all available audio languages
const availableLanguages = rxPlayer
  .getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .map((track) => track.language);

// List of audio tracks containing an audio description of what is visually
// happening
const audioDescriptionTracks = rxPlayer
  .getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .filter((track) => track.audioDescription);

// List of video tracks for which a profile with a 1080p resolution is available
const highResVideoTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks().filter((track) => {
  return track.representations.some(
    (representation) =>
      representation.height !== undefined && representation.height >= 1080,
  );
});

// List of text tracks available in french
const frenchTextTracks = rxPlayer
  .getAvailableTextTracks()
  .filter((track) => track.normalized === "fra");
```

#### Using events

If you want to be alerted when the list of currently available tracks is set or change, it
might be a good idea to rely on events.

Here are the three events you will need to know:

- [`"availableAudioTracksChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#availableaudiotrackschange):
  the list of available audio tracks for what is currently being played was just updated.

- [`"availableVideoTracksChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#availablevideotrackschange):
  idem for video tracks

- [`"availableTextTracksChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#availabletexttrackschange):
  idem for text tracks

All of those events will have the corresponding available tracks as a payload, which will
be the exact same data that what you would get when calling the corresponding
`getAvailable...Tracks` method at this point.

Note that no `available...TracksChange` event will be sent when the RxPlayer stops the
content or temporarly goes through the `RELOADING` player state with an empty array as a
payload - as there is no current content in those cases.

##### Examples

Like any RxPlayer event, you will need to add an event listener for those:

```js
let currentAudioTracks = [];
let currentVideoTracks = [];
let currentTextTracks = [];

rxPlayer.addEventListener("availableAudioTracksChange", (audioTracks) => {
  console.log("New audio tracks:", audioTracks);
  currentAudioTracks = audioTracks;
});

rxPlayer.addEventListener("availableVideoTracksChange", (videoTracks) => {
  console.log("New video tracks:", videoTracks);
  currentVideoTracks = videoTracks;
});

rxPlayer.addEventListener("availableTextTracksChange", (textTracks) => {
  console.log("New text tracks:", textTracks);
  currentTextTracks = textTracks;
});
```

### Advanced case: Any part of multi-Period contents

For contents with multiple [Periods](../Glossary.md#period) and/or when in the `LOADING`
or `RELOADING` state, you may want to list the tracks for a part of the content that the
RxPlayer is not yet playing.

This can be for example for a future/previous live program, or even for the current one
when the RxPlayer did not yet begin to play it.

In those conditions, the three methods presented here (`getAvailableVideoTracks`,
`getAvailableTextTracks` and `getAvailableAudioTracks`) can all take an argument: the `id`
property of the wanted period:

```js
// Getting the audio track list for the Period with the "foo" id.
rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks("foo");
```

That `id` can be known in several ways:

- the [`getAvailablePeriods` method](../../api/Basic_Methods/getAvailablePeriods.md) can
  list the different Periods and their respective `id` property:

  ```js
  const periods = rxPlayer.getAvailablePeriods();
  for (const period of periods) {
    console.log(
      `Tracks for Period ${period.id}:`,
      rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks(period.id),
    );
  }
  ```

- the [`newAvailablePeriods` event](../../api/Player_Events.md#newavailableperiods)
  triggered each time new Periods are known (either when the content is first loaded, or
  when the it is updated) with their respective `id` property:

  ```js
  rxPlayer.addEventListener("newAvailablePeriods, (periods) => {
    for (const period of periods) {
      console.log(`Tracks for Period ${period.id}:`,
                  rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks(period.id));
    }
  });
  ```

- the [`periodChange` event](../../api/Player_Events.md#periodchange) triggered when the
  current Period being played changes, with the corresponding `id` property:
  ```js
  rxPlayer.addEventListener("periodChange, (period) => {
    console.log(`Tracks for the current Period ${period.id}:`,
                rxPlayer.getAvailableAudioTracks(period.id));
  });
  ```

### Obtaining those lists as soon as possible

The RxPlayer does not "guess" the tracks available for a given content, it usually finds
every information about them in the Manifest file which is loaded at the beginning.

Thus, the list of available tracks will only be available once the RxPlayer has loaded and
parsed that Manifest. Moreover, a Manifest can have several lists of available tracks
depending on the player's position (for example, a live channel with multiple programs
might have different audio languages available for different programs).

This means both that the available tracks won't generally be known just after a
`loadVideo` call and that it can then change at any time. The first instant when the list
of available audio, video and text tracks is available after loading the content through
`loadVideo` is on the
[`newAvailablePeriods`](../../api/Player_Events.md#newavailableperiods) event:

```js
rxPlayer.loadVideo({ url: "foo/bar", transport: "dash" /* ... */ });
rxPlayer.addEventListener("newAvailablePeriods", (periods) => {
  for (const period of periods) {
    const periodId = period.id;
    const videoTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks(periodId);
    const audioTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableVideoTracks(periodId);
    const textTracks = rxPlayer.getAvailableTextTracks(periodId);
    console.log(`Video tracks for Period "${periodId}":`${videoTracks}`);
    console.log(`Audio tracks for Period "${periodId}":`${audioTracks}`);
    console.log(`Text tracks for Period "${periodId}":`${textTracks}`);
  }
});
```

This `newAvailablePeriods` event is also the right one for setting the initial track (we
will see how to below), as it's guaranteed that at the point this event is sent, no media
data has been loaded yet for the corresponding Period(s):

```js
rxPlayer.addEventListener("newAvailablePeriods", (periods) => {
  for (const period of periods) {
    // Theoretical logic for initial track selections (presumably through the
    // `getAvailable...Tracks` and `set...Track` families of API)
    setInitialVideoTrack(period);
    setInitialAudioTrack(period);
    setInitialTextTrack(period);
  }
});
```

## Knowing the current track

### Nominal case: currently played content

#### Using methods

You might also want to know which track is the one currently selected. There are several
ways to do that.

### Through methods

The RxPlayer has a set of methods that just return the currently active tracks:

- [`getAudioTrack`](../../api/Track_Selection/getAudioTrack.md): return information on the
  current audio track

- [`getVideoTrack`](../../api/Track_Selection/getVideoTrack.md): return information on the
  current video track

- [`getTextTrack`](../../api/Track_Selection/getTextTrack.md): return information on the
  current text track

Those methods will return an object describing the attributes of the current tracks. They
can also return `null` if no track has been enabled (for example, the user could have
wanted to disable all text tracks) and `undefined` if the track is either unknown (which
is a very rare occurence) or if no content is currently playing.

Like the `getAvailable...Tracks` methods, the format of the objects returned will entirely
depend on which method you call. You can refer to the API documentation to get more
information on this.

Also like the `getAvailable...Tracks` methods, the current text track will usually only be
known once the RxPlayer has loaded a content (which means we are not in the `STOPPED`,
`LOADING` or `RELOADING` [player state](../../api/Player_States.md)). If no content is
loaded, those APIs will just return `undefined`.

#### Examples

Here is an example on how you could use them:

```js
const currentTextTrack = rxPlayer.getTextTrack();
if (currentTextTrack === null) {
  console.log("No text track is enabled");
} else if (currentTextTrack === undefined) {
  console.log(
    "We don't know the current text track. " + "Are you sure a content is loaded?",
  );
} else {
  const language = currentTextTrack.language;
  console.log("We have a current text track in the " + language + "language");
}
```

### Through events

Exactly like you would obtain the list of available tracks through the
`available...TracksChange` events, you can know when the current track change as soon as
possible through the following events:

- [`"audioTrackChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#audiotrackchange): the
  currently-active audio track changed

- [`"videoTrackChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#videotrackchange): the
  currently-active video track changed

- [`"textTrackChange"`](../../api/Player_Events.md#texttrackchange): the currently-active
  text track changed

Those events just emit the current track information as soon as it changes, in the same
format that the `get...Track` methods.

Unlike for the `get...Track` methods however, its payload cannot be set to `undefined`:
you won't receive any `...TracksChange` event if the track is unknown or if there is no
content.

This also means that you won't have any event when the RxPlayer stops or re-load the
current content, despite the fact that you don't have any current track in that case.
Calling the `get...Track` method in those cases will return `undefined`, as it should.
This has to be considered.

#### Example

Like for any events, you will have to register an event listener:

```js
rxPlayer.addEventListener("textTrackChange", (track) => {
  if (track === null) {
    console.log("No text track is active");
  } else {
    console.log("new active text track in the following language: " + track.language);
  }
});
```

### Through the list of available tracks

As written earlier the `available...TracksChange` events and the `getAvailable...Tracks`
methods both return arrays of objects, each object defining a single track.

In each of those object, you will find an `active` boolean property, which will be set to
`true` if the track is the currently chosen one and `false` otherwise.

Note that it's possible that none of the available tracks are active. This is for example
the case when the track has been disabled (for example when the user wants no text tracks
at all).

```js
// get the active audio track through `getAvailableAudioTracks`
const activeAudioTrack1 = rxPlayer
  .getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .find((track) => track.active);

// get the active audio track through `availableAudioTracksChange`
let activeAudioTrack2;
rxPlayer.addEventListener("availableAudioTracksChange", (tracks) => {
  activeAudioTrack2 = tracks.find((track) => track.active);
});
```

### Which one to use?

As usual here, this is highly dependant on your application. All of those APIs give the
same information through different means.

Accessing with the `get...Track` method is simple to use, the events allow to know at the
earliest possible time and relying on the list of available tracks can simplify your code
if you want both of them.

## Selecting a track

Now that we have the list of available tracks and the current one, we might want to choose
another one, or let the final user choose another one.

To do that, you will have to use one of those three RxPlayer methods:

- [`setAudioTrack()`](../../api/Track_Selection/setAudioTrack.md): change the current
  audio track
- [`setVideoTrack()`](../../api/Track_Selection/setVideoTrack.md): change the current
  video track
- [`setTextTrack()`](../../api/Track_Selection/setTextTrack.md): change the current text
  track

Each of those methods take a single string as argument. That string should be the value of
the `id` property of the chosen track.

For example, to choose the first audio track with an audio description, you can do:

```js
const firstAudioTrackWithAD = rxPlayer
  .getAvailableAudioTracks()
  .find((track) => track.audioDescription);

if (firstAudioTrackWithAD !== undefined) {
  rxPlayer.setAudioTrack(firstAudioTrackWithAD.id);
}
```

It's important to consider that those APIs only allow to change the current track and will
have no impact on the other contents you will encounter in the future.

After manually setting a track through the `set...Track` methods, you will receive the
corresponding `...TrackChange` event when the change is applied.

Note that on some contents, changing a track from a given type might automatically also
change the current track for another types. For example, switching to another audio
language might also automatically turn on the subtitles. This is because some streaming
protocols might "force" some combination.

To detect those cases, you can either listen to every `...TrackChange` events or call the
corresponding `get...Track` method everytime you want to use them.

## Disabling a track

Now what if you want no track at all?

This is for example a frequent need for text tracks, where you might prefer to have no
subtitles or closed captions appearing on the screen.

You could also want to disable the video track, which is a trick often used to reduce the
network bandwidth used by a content.

You can disable respectively the current text track and the current video track by calling
those methods:

- [`disableTextTrack`](../../api/Track_Selection/disableTextTrack.md)
- [`disableVideoTrack`](../../api/Track_Selection/disableVideoTrack.md)

However, like for selecting a track, this only concerns the current content being played.
When playing a new content or even when just switching to another part of the content with
a different track list, you might need to re-do the same method call.

## Tracks now missing from the Manifest

There is a very unlikely event that could theoretically arise on some contents: the select
track disappearing after a Manifest update.

For example, after refreshing the Manifest files, it turns out that the
previously-selected audio track has been completely removed from the Manifest, for the
same Period.

Here, the RxPlayer will by itself select another track instead and immediately emit a
[`"trackUpdate"` event](../../api/Player_Events.md#trackupdate) a `reason` property set to
`"missing"`:

```js
rxPlayer.addEventListener("trackUpdate", (data) => {
  if (data.reason === "missing") {
    console.warn(
      `The previously-chosen ${data.trackType} track for the Period ` +
        `"${data.period.id}" disappeared. A new track has been selected instead.`,
    );
  }
});
```

## Notes about the "textTrackMode" option

This tutorial was focused on track selection but there's still a last point I want to
approach, which is how subtitles will be displayed to the user.

By default, text tracks will be displayed through `<tracks>` elements which will be
contained in the media element where the content plays. This allows to display subtitles
but may not be sufficient when wanting to display richer subtitles (such as
closed-captions).

This is why the RxPlayer has a
[`textTrackMode`](../../api/Loading_a_Content.md#texttrackmode) concept.

By setting the `textTrackMode` to `"html"` in a
[`loadVideo`](../../api/Loading_a_Content.md) call, you will be able to profit from much
richer subtitles than what you could have by default. If you do that, you also need to set
the [`textTrackElement`](../../api/Loading_a_Content.md#texttrackelement) property to an
HTML element, that the RxPlayer will use to display subtitles into.

More information on those options can be found in the RxPlayer API.
