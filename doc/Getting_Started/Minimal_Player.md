# Importing a minimal player with feature selection

## Overview

The RxPlayer comes with many features, even some you might never need.
For example, you may only care for DASH with TTML subtitles and not about
Smooth streaming, VTT or SRT parsing.

Because each implementation has its need, we permit multiple ways to import
the player with limited features.

This customization can be done by importing the minimal version of the RxPlayer
and then adding only the features your want.
This allows to greatly reduce the final bundle size, if your bundler (esbuild,
webpack, rollup, vite...) support
[tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking), like most do.

## How it works

If you imported the RxPlayer library through the npm package (like via the
`npm install rx-player` command), you can import a minimal version of the player
by importing it from `"rx-player/minimal"`:

```js
import MinimalRxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";

// This player has the same API than the RxPlayer, but with no feature
// (e.g. no DASH, Smooth or Directfile playback)
const player = new MinimalRxPlayer();

// use the regular APIs...
player.setVolume(0.5);
```

You then will need to add the features you want on it. Those can be accessed
through the path `"rx-player/features"`:

```js
// import the DASH and Smooth features, which will be added to the RxPlayer
import { DASH, SMOOTH } from "rx-player/features";
```

At last you can add those features to the imported RxPlayer class by calling the
`addFeatures` static method:

```js
// addFeatures takes an array of features as argument
MinimalRxPlayer.addFeatures([DASH, SMOOTH]);
```

Here is the complete example:

```js
import MinimalRxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import { DASH, SMOOTH } from "rx-player/features";

MinimalRxPlayer.addFeatures([DASH, SMOOTH]);
```

There is also "experimental" features. Such features can completely change from
one version to the next - unlike regular features which just follows semantic
versioning. This means that you may have to keep the concerned code up-to-date
each time you depend on a new RxPlayer version.
Such features are imported from `"rx-player/experimental/features"` instead:

```js
import MinimalRxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import { LOCAL_MANIFEST } from "rx-player/experimental/features";

MinimalRxPlayer.addFeatures([LOCAL_MANIFEST]);
```

You can of course depend on both experimental and regular features:

```js
import MinimalRxPlayer from "rx-player/minimal";
import { DASH, SMOOTH } from "rx-player/features";
import { LOCAL_MANIFEST } from "rx-player/experimental/features";

MinimalRxPlayer.addFeatures([DASH, SMOOTH, LOCAL_MANIFEST]);
```

By using the minimal version, you will reduce the final bundle file **if
tree-shaking is performed on the final code (like in webpack's production
mode)**.

The key is just to know which feature does what.
You can refer to the [RxPlayer Features documentation page](../api/RxPlayer_Features.md) for
this.
