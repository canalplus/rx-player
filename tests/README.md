# Tests ########################################################################

This directory regroups the RxPlayer's tests.

For now, they are of three natures:

  - unit tests: they test specific and sensitive parts of the Player.

    They are written in directories named ``__test__`` alongside the
    corresponding tested code (in `src`).
    What's present in the ``unit`` directory here is just configuration code
    necessary to launch those tests.

  - integration tests: they test the player globally, by simulating different
    "scenarios" (like playing a content and seeking to an un-buffered part).

    They are written here in the ``integration`` directory.

  - memory tests: they check specifically the memory usage of the player.

    They are written here in the ``memory`` directory.

The ``contents`` directory exports mock contents useful for the ``integration``
and ``memory`` tests. The syntax of those mocks is specific, please refer to
those already present before creating a new one.

The ``utils`` directory exports helper functions useful for the ``integration``
and ``memory`` tests.
