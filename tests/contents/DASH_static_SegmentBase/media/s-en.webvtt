00:03.837 --> 00:07.297
Captain's log, stardate 41636.9.

00:07.466 --> 00:11.846
As feared, our examination of the
overdue Federation freighter Odin,

00:12.012 --> 00:16.472
disabled by an asteroid collision,
revealed no life signs.

00:16.642 --> 00:19.022
However three escape pods
were missing,

00:19.186 --> 00:21.936
suggesting
the possibility of survivors.

00:22.606 --> 00:27.866
- Ready to orbit Angel One.
- What kind of place is this, Data?

00:28.028 --> 00:31.618
A Class-M planet supporting
carbon-based flora and fauna,

00:31.782 --> 00:34.322
sparsely populated
with intelligent life.

00:34.493 --> 00:38.493
Similar in technological development
to mid-20th century Earth.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.004
Kinda like being marooned at home.

00:41.166 --> 00:43.586
Assuming any survivors
made it this far.

00:43.794 --> 00:49.174
It is the closest planet, but to
go the distance we did in two days,

00:49.341 --> 00:52.341
would've taken the Odin escape pod
five months.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.681
Five months, six days, 11 hours,
two min...

00:54.847 --> 00:58.397
- Thank you, Data.
- ...and 57 seconds.

00:58.559 --> 01:01.349
Receiving an audio signal
from Angel One.
