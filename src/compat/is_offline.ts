/**
 * Some browsers have a builtin API to know if it's connected at least to a
 * LAN network, at most to the internet.
 *
 * /!\ This feature can be dangerous as you can both have false positives and
 * false negatives.
 *
 * False positives:
 *   - you can still play local contents (on localhost) if isOffline == true
 *   - on some browsers isOffline might be true even if we're connected to a LAN
 *     or a router (it would mean we're just not able to connect to the
 *     Internet). So we can eventually play LAN contents if isOffline == true
 *
 * False negatives:
 *   - in some cases, we even might have isOffline at false when we do not have
 *     any connection:
 *       - in browsers that do not support the feature
 *       - in browsers running in some virtualization softwares where the
 *         network adapters are always connected.
 *
 * Use with these cases in mind.
 * @returns {Boolean}
