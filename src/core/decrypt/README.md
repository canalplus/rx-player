# The ContentDecryptor #########################################################


## Overview ####################################################################

This directory exports the `ContentDecryptor`, which allows to easily interface
with the browser APIs for decrypting an encrypted content, it follows the
[Encrypted Media Extensions recommandations](https://www.w3.org/TR/encrypted-media/).

The `ContentDecryptor` is a module isolated from the rest of the player taking
a form of a class.
It starts initializing decryption capabilities as soon as it is instanciated and
emits various events to communicate with external code.

A central concept of the `ContentDecryptor` is its states.
As decryption initialization goes on, it reaches multiple steps on which the
rest of the RxPlayer code might want to react.

Before going in, you're encouraged to read a little about the Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME). This code is heavy on EME APIs and may be difficult to follow
if you don't have a vague understanding of the concept of a `MediaKeySession`
or of a `MediaKeySystemAccess`.
