           * that cannot be "maintained".
           *
           * If defined, takes precedence over both `chosenRepFromBandwidth` and
           * `chosenRepFromBufferSize`.
           *

           * only enabled when no other solution is adapted (for now, this just
           * applies for low-latency contents when playing close to the live
           * edge).
           *
           * `null` if not enabled or if there's currently no guess.
