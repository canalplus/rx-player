# RxPlayer Architecture documentation

## Preliminary notes

You will find the architecture documentation alongside the code it documents, as
`README.md` files (like this one).

## Global architecture

The RxPlayer may either run in a multithreaded "mode" or a monothreaded one depending on
how it is configured. To easily allow for both, files containing its main logic are
principally organized between two directories:

-   `./main_thread` contains code that will always run in the main JS thread regardless of
    the RxPlayer's current mode.

-   `./core` contains code that may either run in a separate Worker thread (in the
    multithreaded mode) or in main thread (in monothreaded mode).

There are also several other files and directories those two may depend on.

To better understand the player's architecture, you can find below a simplified schema for
it:

For the subdirectories and files in this directory not represented in that schema:

-   `Compat` (_./compat_): Regroups every functions related to improving compatibility
    with browsers / environments.

-   `errors` (_./errors_): Defines error subclasses, most of all for the API.

-   `experimental` (_./experimental_): Special directory for "experimental" tools and
    features.

-   `features` (_./features_): Special directory allowing feature switching
    (enabling/disallowing features to not include unused code when importing the
    RxPlayer).

-   `manifest` (_./manifest_): Defines a `Manifest` structure and its properties, a
    central structure of the player describing a content.

-   `multithread` (_./multithread_): Global code specific to the multithreaded "flavor" of
    the RxPlayer, that is a specific RxPlayer class which may run its main logic in a
    WebWorker to improve performance.

-   `parsers` (_./parsers_): Various parsers for several formats

-   `tools` (_./tools_): Defines "tools", APIs which are not part of the RxPlayer class.

-   `utils` (_./utils_): Define utils function, small functions which can be used in
    several part of the RxPlayer's code.

-   `config.ts` (_./config.ts_): Exports an interface allowing to update the RxPlayer's
    config.

-   `index.ts` (_./index.ts_): Exports the main entry point for the RxPlayer, with a
    default set of features.

-   `log.ts` (_./log.ts_): Exports the main RxPlayer's Logger instance.

-   `minimal.ts` (_./minimal.ts_): Exports the entry point for the minimal RxPlayer, which
    is an RxPlayer without any feature. When relying on this build, an application will
    have to manually add the specific features it wants.

-   `multithread_types.ts` (_./multithread_types.ts_): TypeScript types used specifically
    when running the RxPlayer in multithread mode.

-   `public_types.ts` (_./public_types.ts_): List all TypeScript types which are part of
    the API.

-   `worker_entry_point.ts` (_./worker_entry_point.ts_): Entry point for the logic of the
    RxPlayer which will run in the WebWorker (and which will have to be loaded separately
    by the application).

## Multithread, Monothread and Directfile code paths

There are actually three different main "code paths" that may be run, depending on the
current content played.

The previous schema mostly illustrated the most complex code path of the three (the
"multithread mode"). Yet, to be more exact we need to separate those three cases:

1. For "directfile" contents (contents directly decodable by the browser, e.g. mp4 files
   or HLS playlists on Safari), the code path is the simplest and follows something like
   this:

    ```
                   +---------------------------------------------+
                   |               Application/UI                |

                             | call RxPlayer API
                             |

         |               Public API              | uses | MediaElementTracksStore |

         a "directfile"      |                          using directly the media
         content             V                          element's API (`audioTracks`,
         +---------------------------------------+      `textTracks` etc.)

         |          (./main_thread/init)         |
         +---------------------------------------+
                             |
                             V
                            ... Some other RxPlayer modules
                                (All running in main thread)
    ```

    As you can see, everything runs in main thread, a specialized module called the
    `DirectfileContentInitializer` is called by the API to start-up such contents and a
    specialized `MediaElementTracksStore` is handling tracks specifically for directfile
    contents (as they are handled differently than for other code paths, here trough API
    exposed by the browser)have .

2. A second code path, we may call the "monothreaded code path" apply for non-directfile
   contents (so, contents which rely on MSE API instead) loaded in monothreaded mode,
   which is the default.

    It is much closer to the schema of the previous chapter:

    ```

    ```

    As you can see, the part of `./main_thread/init` run by the API is this time different
    (`MediaSourceContentInitializer`) and the track handling also goes to a differently
    named `TracksStore` when compared to directfile contents.

    I also summarized all core modules into a single block, you can refer to the previous
    chapter to have some examples of what they are (you can look at modules in the
    `./core` directory in that schema - or at the `./core` directory itself).

3. A third code path, the "multithreaded code path" apply for non-directfile contents (so,
   contents which rely on MSE API instead) loaded in "multithread mode" (which has to be
   explicitely enabled by the application).

    Here you get all the complexity of the previous chapter, with two threads running. To
    repeat the schema than the one used for the other code paths here, you would have
    something like:

    ```

         +--------------------------------------+
    ```

    This time, the part of `./main_thread/init` run by the API is the
    `MultiThreadContentInitializer` and the track handling also goes through the
    `TracksStore`, like for the monothreaded code path.

    The main difference however is that now all core modules are running completely in a
    WebWorker, meaning in another thread. It is the role of the
    `MultiThreadContentInitializer` to send message to it and to process most of the
    messages the WebWorker sends back.

    Because this time, the core also has to reception and send backs messages from and to
    the main thread, there's a supplementary core module involved than on the
    "monothreaded code path", the "Worker Main". It then however relies on the exact same
    other core modules than for the "monothreaded code path".
