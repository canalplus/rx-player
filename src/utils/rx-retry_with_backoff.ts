/**
 * Retry the given observable (if it triggers an error) with an exponential
 * backoff.
 * The backoff behavior can be tweaked through the options given.
 *
 * @param {Observable} obs$
 * @param {Object} options - Configuration object.
 * This object contains the following properties:
 *
 *   - retryDelay {Number} - The initial delay, in ms.
 *     This delay will be fuzzed to fall under the range +-30% each time a new
 *     retry is done.
 *     Then, this delay will be multiplied by 2^(n-1), n being the counter of
 *     retry we performed (beginning at 1 for the first retry).
 *
 *   - totalRetry {Number} - The amount of time we should retry. 0
 *     means no retry, 1 means a single retry, Infinity means infinite retry
 *     etc.
 *     If the observable still fails after this number of retry, the error will
 *     be throwed through this observable.
 *
 *   - shouldRetry {Function|undefined} -  Function which will receive the
 *     observable error each time it fails, and should return a boolean. If this
 *     boolean is false, the error will be directly thrown (without anymore
 *     retry).
 *
 *   - onRetry {Function|undefined} - Function which will be triggered at
 *     each retry. Will receive two arguments:
 *       1. The observable error
 *       2. The current retry count, beginning at 1 for the first retry
 *
 * @returns {Observable}
 * TODO Take errorSelector out. Should probably be entirely managed in the
 * calling code via a catch (much simpler to use and to understand).
