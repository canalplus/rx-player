/**
 * This file contains functions helping with TimeRanges management.
 *
 * For simplicity/performance reasons, many of those work with a simplified
 * "Range" object, which is an object with two keys:
 *   - start {Number}
 *   - end {Number}
 *
 * Those two corresponds to what is returned by the start and end methods of a
 * TimeRanges Object.
 *
 * You can convert from TimeRanges to Range object(s) with the getRange/
 * convertToRanges methods.
