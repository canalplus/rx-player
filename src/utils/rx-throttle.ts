 * Throttle an asynchronous function (returning an Observable or Promise) to

 * @example
 * ```js
 * const fn = (time) => Observable.timer(time);
 * const throttled = throttle(fn);
 *
 * const Obs1 = throttled(2000); // -> call fn(2000) and returns its Observable
 * const Obs2 = throttled(1000); // -> won't do anything, Obs2 is an empty
 *                               //    observable (it directly completes)
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   const Obs3 = throttled(1000); // -> will call fn(1000)
 * }, 2001);

 * @param {Function} func
 * @returns {Function} - Function taking in argument the arguments you want
 * to give your function, and returning an Observable.
