/**
 * At subscription, instead of "running" the Observable right away, wait until
 * the current task has finished executing before actually running this
 * Observable.
 *
 * This can be important for example when you want in a given function to
 * exploit the same shared Observable which may send synchronous events directly
 * after subscription.
 *
 * Here, you might be left in a situation where the first element subscribing to
 * that Observable will receive those synchronous events immediately on
 * subscription. Further subscriptions on that Observable will miss out on those
 * events - even if those subscriptions happen synchronously after the first
 * one.
 *
 * Calling `deferSubscriptions` in those cases will make sure that all such
 * subscriptions can be registered before the Observable start emitting events
 * (as long as such Subscriptions are done synchronously).
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 * const myObservable = rxjs.timer(100).pipe(mapTo("ASYNC MSG"),
 *                                           startWith("SYNCHRONOUS MSG"),
 *                                           share());
 *
 * myObservable.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub1:", x));
 * myObservable.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub2:", x));
 *
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   myObservable.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub3:", x));
 * }, 50);
 *
 * // You will get:
 * // Sub1: SYNCHRONOUS MSG
 * // Sub1: ASYNC MSG
 * // Sub2: ASYNC MSG
 * // Sub3: ASYNC MSG
 *
 * // ------------------------------
 *
 * const myObservableDeferred = rxjs.timer(100).pipe(mapTo("ASYNC MSG"),
 *                                                   startWith("SYNCHRONOUS MSG"),
 *                                                   deferSubscriptions(),
 *                                                   // NOTE: the order is important here
 *                                                   share());
 *
 * myObservableDeferred.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub1:", x));
 * myObservableDeferred.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub2:", x));
 *
 * setTimeout(() => {
 *   myObservableDeferred.subscribe(x => console.log("Sub3:", x));
 * }, 50);
 *
 * // You will get:
 * // Sub1: SYNCHRONOUS MSG
 * // Sub2: SYNCHRONOUS MSG
 * // Sub1: ASYNC MSG
 * // Sub2: ASYNC MSG
 * // Sub3: ASYNC MSG
