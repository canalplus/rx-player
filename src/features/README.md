# Features code

This directory regroups the code importing all the "features" of the RxPlayer piece by
piece.

It is mostly used for allowing a library user to only imports some features of the
RxPlayer without importing others.

How this is technically done is through a global `features` Object, which will have added
properties (which corresponds to those features' code) each time a new feature is added.
