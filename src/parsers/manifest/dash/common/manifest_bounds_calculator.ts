 * This class allows to easily calculate the first and last available positions
 * in a content at any time.
 *
 * That task can be an hard for dynamic DASH contents: it depends on a
 * `timeShiftBufferDepth` defined in the MPD and on the maximum possible
 * position.
 *
 * The latter can come from either a clock synchronization mechanism or the
 * indexing schemes (e.g. SegmentTemplate, SegmentTimeline etc.) of the last
 * Periods.
 * As such, it might only be known once a large chunk of the MPD has already
 * been parsed.
 *
 * By centralizing the manifest bounds calculation in this class and by giving
 * an instance of it to each parsed elements which might depend on it, we
 * ensure that we can provide it once it is known to every one of those
 * elements without needing to parse a second time the MPD.
