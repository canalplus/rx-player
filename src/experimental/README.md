# Experimental tools and features ##############################################

This directory defines "experimental" tools and features, which are tools and
features that:
  - might rapidly evolve and change without needing to publish a new major
    version.
  - might be removed at any new RxPlayer version.
  - have less stability guarantees than other features and tools in the RxPlayer

The experimental tools' code is often directly written in that directory.

The experimental features' code however is most often written in their
respective "normal" directory in the RxPlayer code, to then be imported through
this directory.
This last step is mainly to confine the "library path" of that feature to the
`rx-player/experimental/features` subdirectory.

Note that tools NEED to be declared in their own directory inside a
`./tools/<TOOL_NAME>` directory, with their inner `index.js` file exporting
them, as that's a requirement from our exporting strategy.
