/**
 * Type wrapping an underlying value that might either be obtained synchronously
 * (a "sync" value) or asynchronously by awaiting a Promise (an "async" value).
 *
 * This type was created instead of just relying on Promises everytime, to
 * avoid the necessity of always having the overhead and more complex
 * always-async behavior of a Promise for a value that might be in most time
 * obtainable synchronously.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const val1 = SyncOrAsync.createAsync(Promise.resolve("foo"));
 * const val2 = SyncOrAsync.createSync("bar");
 *
 * async function logVal(val : ISyncOrAsyncValue<String>) : void {
 *   // The following syntax allows to only await asynchronous values
 *   console.log(val.syncValue ?? await val.getValueAsAsync());
 * }
 *
 * logVal(val1);
 * logVal(val2);
 *
 * // Here this will first log in the console "bar" directly and synchronously.
 * // Then asychronously through a microtask (as Promises and awaited values
 * // always are), "foo" will be logged.
 * ```
