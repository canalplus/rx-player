 * Calculating a live-offseted media position necessitate to obtain first an

 * That offset is in most case present inside the Manifest file, yet in cases
 * without it or without a Manifest, such as the "directfile" mode, the RxPlayer
 * won't know that offset.
 *
 * Thankfully Safari declares a `getStartDate` method allowing to obtain that

 * in directfile mode on Safari.
