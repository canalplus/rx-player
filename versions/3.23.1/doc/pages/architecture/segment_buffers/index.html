<h1>The SegmentBuffers</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <code>core/segment_buffers</code> directory contains the part of the code directly
related to the insertion and removal of media segments to a buffer for later
decoding.</p>
<p>This is either done through native <code>SourceBuffers</code>, which are JavaScript objects
implemented by the browser or a custom buffer implementation entirely defined
in the code of the RxPlayer.</p>
<p>The interface through which the RxPlayer‚Äôs code push segment is called the
<code>SegmentBuffer</code>, it comes on top of the buffer implementation (regardless if it
comes from native <code>SourceBuffer</code> objects or if it is a custom one).</p>
<p>A <code>SegmentBuffer</code> is defined for a type of media (e.g. ‚Äúvideo‚Äù, ‚Äúaudio‚Äù,
‚Äútext‚Äù‚Ä¶) they are defined in the <code>src/core/segment_buffers/implementations</code>
directory.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a simplified architecture schema of the code in that directory:</p>

<h2>SegmentBuffersStore</h2>
<p>The <code>SegmentBuffersStore</code> is the main export from there.
It facilitates the creation and destruction of these <code>SegmentBuffers</code>.</p>
<p>Its roles are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>announce which types of <code>SegmentBuffer</code> can be currently created on the
HTMLMediaElement (example of a type of buffer would be ‚Äúaudio‚Äù, ‚Äúvideo‚Äù or
‚Äútext‚Äù).</p>
<p>For example, no ‚Äúvideo‚Äù <code>SegmentBuffer</code> should be created on an <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>
element (though it wouldn‚Äôt cause any problem, it would be useless
as video cannot be rendered here). To give another example, you should not
create a ‚Äútext‚Äù <code>SegmentBuffer</code> if no text track parser has been added to
the RxPlayer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create only one <code>SegmentBuffer</code> instance per type of buffer.</p>
<p>Multiple <code>SegmentBuffer</code> for a single type could lead to browser issues
and to conflicts in the RxPlayer code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a synchronization mechanism to announce when all <code>SourceBuffers</code> are
ready to receive segments.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll explain:</p>
<p><code>SourceBuffers</code> are browser implementations for media data buffers.
They typically are used by the ‚Äúvideo‚Äù and ‚Äúaudio‚Äù <code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
<p>Among several other constraints, all <code>SourceBuffers</code> needed to play a
given content should be created before we can start pushing segments to any
of them. This is a browser limitation.</p>
<p>This is where this synchronization mechanism can become useful. The
<code>SegmentBuffersStore</code> will signal when all of the <code>SourceBuffers</code>
needed for the given contents are created, so that the rest of the RxPlayer
knows when it can begin to push segments to those.</p>
<p>Note that this means that <code>SourceBuffers</code> for an un-needed type (e.g. an
audio content won‚Äôt need a video <code>SourceBuffer</code>) have to be explicitely
‚Äúdisabled‚Äù here, as the <code>SegmentBuffersStore</code> cannot know whether it should
wait until those <code>SourceBuffers</code> are created of if you just don‚Äôt need it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-SegmentBuffers%20implementations"></a></p>
<h2>SegmentBuffers implementations</h2>
<p>A <code>SegmentBuffer</code> is an Object maintaining a media buffer for a given type (e.g.
‚Äúaudio‚Äù, ‚Äúvideo‚Äù, ‚Äútext‚Äù etc.) used for later decoding.</p>
<p>There exists several <code>SegmentBuffer</code> implementations in the RxPlayer‚Äôs code
depending on the type concerned.
An implementation takes the form of a class with a well-defined API shared with
every other implementations. It allows to push segments, remove data and
retrieve information about the data that is contained within it.</p>
<p>At its core, it can either rely on a browser-defined <code>SourceBuffer</code> Object or
can be entirely defined in the code of the RxPlayer.</p>
<p>A <code>SegmentBuffer</code> also keeps an inventory containing the metadata of all
segments currently contained in it, with the help of a <code>SegmentInventory</code>
Object (see corresponding chapter).</p>
<p>It is the main interface the rest of the RxPlayer code has with media buffers.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-BufferGarbageCollector"></a></p>
<h2>BufferGarbageCollector</h2>
<p>The <code>BufferGarbageCollector</code> is a function used by the RxPlayer to
periodically perform ‚Äúgarbage collection‚Äù manually on a given
<code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
<p>It is based on the following building bricks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A clock, which is an observable emitting the current time (in seconds) when
the garbage collection task should be performed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>SegmentBuffer</code> on which the garbage collection task should run</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum time margin authorized for the buffer behind the current
position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum time margin authorized for the buffer ahead of the current
position</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, each times the given clock ticks, the BufferGarbageCollector will
ensure that the volume of data before and ahead of the current position does not
grow into a larger value than what is configured.</p>
<p>For now, its code is completely decoupled for the rest of the code in that
directory. This is why it is not included in the schema included on the top of
this page.</p>

<h2>The SegmentInventory</h2>
<p>The <code>SegmentInventory</code> keeps track of which segments are currently bufferized
to avoid unnecessary re-downloads.</p>
<p>You can have more information on it in <a href="segment_inventory.html">the SegmentInventory
documentation</a>.</p>
