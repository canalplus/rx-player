<h1>RepresentationStream</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The <code>RepresentationStream</code> download and push segments linked to a given
Representation.</p>
<p>It constructs a list of segments to download, which depend on the current
playback conditions.
It then download and push them to a linked <code>SegmentBuffer</code> (the media buffer
containing the segments for later decoding).</p>
<p>Multiple <code>RepresentationStream</code> observables can be ran on the same
<code>SegmentBuffer</code> without problems, as long as they are linked to different
Periods of the Manifest.
This allows for example smooth transitions between multiple periods.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Return%20value"></a></p>
<h2>Return value</h2>
<p>The <code>RepresentationStream</code> returns an Observable which emits multiple
notifications depending on what is happening at its core, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when segments are scheduled for download</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when segments are pushed to the associated <code>SegmentBuffer</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when the Manifest needs to be refreshed to obtain information on possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the <code>RepresentationStream</code> finished to load segments until the end
of the current Period. This can for example allow the creation of a
<code>RepresentationStream</code> for the next Period for pre-loading purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether there are discontinuities: holes in the stream that won‚Äôt be filled
by segments and can thus be skipped</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-Queue%20Algorithm"></a></p>
<h2>Queue Algorithm</h2>
<p>The RepresentationStream depends on a central algorithm to make sure that the
right segments are scheduled for download at any time.</p>
<p>This algorithm constructs a queue of segments to download at any time, and
regularly checks that the segment currently downloaded still corresponds to the
currently most needed Segment.</p>
<p>This list of segments is based on a simple calculation between the current
position and the buffer size we want to achieve.
This list goes then through multiple filters to ensure we‚Äôre not queueing them
unnecessarly. Such cases would be, for example, if the segment is already
present in the <code>SegmentBuffer</code> at a better quality.</p>
<p>For a clock based on various video events, the strategy is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>let <code>segmentQueue</code> be an empty array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On each clock tick, calculate <code>segmentsNeeded</code>, an Array of needed
segments (read: not yet downloaded) from the current time to the buffer
size goal.</p>
<p>Note that the steps <em>2</em> to <em>5</em> can run multiple times while waiting for
a request - happening in step <em>5</em> and <em>8</em>. If that happens,
<code>segmentQueue</code> should equal the last value it has been given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check if there‚Äôs a segment currently downloaded (launched in step <em>8</em>)</p>
<p>3-1. If there is none, let segmentQueue be equal to <code>segmentsNeeded</code></p>
<p>3-2. If there is one but for a segment different than the first element
in <code>segmentsNeeded</code> or if <code>segmentsNeeded</code> is empty, abort
this request and let <code>segmentQueue</code> be equal to <code>segmentsNeeded</code>.</p>
<p>3-3. If there is one and is for the same segment than the first element
in <code>segmentsNeeded</code>, let <code>segmentQueue</code> be equal to
<code>segmentsNeeded</code> without its first element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <code>segmentQueue</code> is empty, go back to <em>2</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>check if there‚Äôs a pending segment request (happening in step <em>8</em>):</p>
<p>5-1. if there‚Äôs no segment request, continue</p>
<p>5-1. if there‚Äôs a pending segment request, go back to <em>2</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let <code>currentSegment</code> be the first segment of <code>segmentQueue</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the first segment from <code>segmentQueue</code> (a.k.a. <code>currentSegment</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform a request for <code>currentSegment</code> and wait for it to finish.
During this time, step <em>2</em> to <em>5</em> can run in parallel, and as such
<code>SegmentQueue</code> can be mutated during this process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the request is finished, run those tasks in parallel:</p>
<p>9-1. Append the segment to the corresponding <code>SegmentBuffer</code></p>
<p>9-1. go back to step <em>4</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
