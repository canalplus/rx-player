<h1>The Stream</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Even if the API is the front-facing block of code in the Rx-player, the Stream
is the part of the code actually starting the logic behind playing a content.</p>
<p>Its code is written in the <code>src/core/stream</code> directory. More specifically,
all code needed in the rest of the code should be exported by its &#x201C;index file&#x201D;
<code>src/core/stream/index.ts</code>.</p>
<p>Every time you&#x2019;re calling the API to load a new video, the Stream function is
called by it with a handful of arguments.</p>
<p>The Stream does then the major part of the job and communicate back its progress
to the API through events.</p>
<pre><code>                 +-----------+
 1. LOAD VIDEO   |           |      2. CALLS
---------------&gt; |    API    | -------------------+
                 |           |                    |
                 +-----------+                    |
                       ^                          v
                       |                    +--------------+
                       |   3. EMIT EVENTS   |              |
                       +------------------- |    STREAM    |
                                            |              |
                                            +--------------+
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, the job of the Stream is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>initialize the content (creating the MediaSource, downloading the manifest)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect most core parts of the player together, such as adaptive
streaming management, segment pipelines, DRMs, speed management&#x2026;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Call with the right argument the PeriodBufferManager, which will download
and push segment to be decoded by the browser.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, during the various events happening on content playback, the Stream
will create / destroy / update various player blocks. Such example of blocks
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adaptive streaming management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DRM management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manifest loading, parsing and refreshing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffer management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#x2026;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-Usage"></a></p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Concretely, the Stream is a function which returns an Observable.
This Observable:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>will automatically load the described content on subscription</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>will automatically stop and clean-up infos related to the content on
unsubscription</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>communicate on various streaming events through emitted notifications</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>throw in the case of a fatal error (i.e. an error interrupting playback)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="subchapter-Communication%20between%20the%20API%20and%20the%20Stream"></a></p>
<h3>Communication between the API and the Stream</h3>
<p>Objects emitted by the Observable is the only way the Stream should be able to
communicate with the API.</p>
<p>The API is then able to communicate back to the Stream, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>by Observable provided by the API as arguments when the Stream function was
called</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>by emitting through Subject provided by the Stream, as a payload of one of
its event</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, there is three ways the API and Stream can communicate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>API -&gt; Stream: When the Stream function is called (so a single time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stream -&gt; API: Through events emitted by the returned Observable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>API -&gt; Stream: Through Observables/Subjects the Stream is in possession of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="subchapter-Emitted%20Events"></a></p>
<h3>Emitted Events</h3>
<p>Events allows the Stream to reports milestones of the content playback, such as
when the content is ready to play.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s also a way for the Stream to communicate informations about the content and
give some controls to the user.</p>
<p>For example, as available audio languages are only known after the manifest has
been downloaded and parsed, and as it is most of all a user preference, the
Stream can emit to the API, RxJS Subjects allowing the API to &#x201C;choose&#x201D; at any
time the wanted language.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-The%20SpeedManager"></a></p>
<h2>The SpeedManager</h2>
<p>The SpeedManager is the part of the Stream updating the playback speed of the
content.</p>
<p>Playback speed can be updated on two occasions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the API set a new Speed (<code>speed$</code> Observable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the content needs to build its buffer.</p>
<p>In which case, the playback speed will be set to 0 (paused) even if the
API set another speed.
The regular speed will be set when enough buffer is available.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>The StallingManager</h3>
<p>The StallingManager listens to various browser events and properties to detect
when the player is &#x201C;stalled&#x201D; (i.e. stuck on the current position).</p>
<p>It then try to adopt a strategy to easily get out of this situation if it can.</p>
