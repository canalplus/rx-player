<h1>SegmentInventory</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The SegmentInventory is a class which registers some information about every
segments currently present in a <code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
<p>One of them is created for every new <code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
<p>This helps the RxPlayer to avoid re-downloading segments unnecessarily and know
when old one have been garbage collected.
For example, we could decide not to re-download a segment in any of the
following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same segment is already completely present in the <code>SegmentBuffer</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same segment is partially present in the <code>SegmentBuffer</code> (read: a part
has been removed or garbage collected), but enough is still there for what
we want to play</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another segment is in the <code>SegmentBuffer</code> at the wanted time, but it is the
same content in a better or samey quality</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the contrary, we need to download the segment in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No segment has been pushed at the given time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed, but at a lower quality than what we currently
want</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed at a sufficient quality, but we miss to much of it
for our needs (too much has been garbage collected, removed or the segment
is just too short).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A segment has been pushed but is not exactly the content we want
(example: it is in another language)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks to the SegmentInventory, we can infer on which situation we are at any time.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>The SegmentInventory is merely a &#x201C;Store&#x201D;, meaning it will just store and
process the data you give to it, without searching for the information itself.</p>
<p>It contains in its state an array, the <em>inventory</em>, which stores every segments
which should be present in the <code>SegmentBuffer</code> in a chronological order.</p>
<p>To construct this inventory, three methods can be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>one to add information about a new chunk (part of a segment or the whole
segment), which should have been pushed to the <code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one to indicate that every chunks from a given segment have been pushed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one to synchronize the currently pushed segments with what the
<code>SegmentBuffer</code> says it has buffered (which can be different for example
after an automatic garbage collection).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After calling the synchronization one, you should be able to tell which parts of
which segments are currently <em>living</em> in your <code>SegmentBuffer</code>.</p>
