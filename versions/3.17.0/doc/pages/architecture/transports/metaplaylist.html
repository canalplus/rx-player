<h1>MetaPlaylist</h1>
<p>The MetaPlaylist is a specific kind of transport: a playlist of different
Manifest.
Its principle and usage is defined <a href="../../api/metaplaylist.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-How%20the%20original%20Manifest%20files%20are%20considered"></a></p>
<h2>How the original Manifest files are considered</h2>
<p>To play a MetaPlaylist content, each manifest it depends on has to be
downloaded and parsed through their original logic (a <code>MPD</code> through DASH&#x2019;s
logic and a Smooth Manifest through Smooth&#x2019;s logic).</p>
<p>We then merge each of these Manifest, to construct an internal
<a href="../../api/manifest.html">Manifest object</a> with the same structure and properties
than we would have with a DASH or Smooth manifest.</p>
<p>The trick is to consider each of those original Manifest as different Periods
(like DASH Periods). The trick works here because the RxPlayer&#x2019;s definition of a
transport (and of the underlying properties) is much more flexible than in DASH.
If an original MPD already has multiple Periods, each of them are also
converted as different RxPlayer&#x2019;s Period so that no feature from the original
content is lost.</p>
<p>Each of those Period is then concatenated one after the other thanks to the time
information anounced in the MetaPlaylist file.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-How%20about%20the%20segments"></a></p>
<h2>How about the segments</h2>
<p>The exploitation of segment metadata is even trickier.</p>
<p>In <code>DASH</code> or <code>Smooth</code>, the URL of each segment could be constructed from the
starting time of each of those segments.</p>
<p>The problem here is that a <code>MetaPlaylist</code> player has to mutate those to place
them at the position indicated in the MetaPlaylist&#x2019;s JSON instead.</p>
<p>To simplify everything, we choose to rely on a simple but effective wrapper on
top of the original transport protocol.</p>
<p>When the core logic of the player wants to load a segment from the network, that
wrapper translate back the data as if we&#x2019;re just playing the original content at
its original position.
How it works: the wrapper removes a specific time offset from the wanted
segment&#x2019;s metadata, before contacting the transport&#x2019;s logic.</p>
<p>When giving back the segment to the core logic of the player, the wrapper first
update those loaded segment with the wanted position data.
How it works: the wrapper adds back the time offset it previously substracted
from the wanted segment&#x2019;s metadata before giving it back to the core logic.</p>
<p>To illustrate, it kind of goes like this:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>To make sure the segment is pushed at the right moment and doesn&#x2019;t overlap other
contents, we make heavy use of some specific <code>SourceBuffer</code> properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>timestampOffset</code> property allows to set a specific offset</li>
<li><code>appendWindowStart</code> allows to limit the starting time of the pushed segment</li>
<li><code>appendWindowEnd</code> allows to limit the ending time of the pushed segment</li>
</ul>
