<h1>Differences between DASH&#x2019; AdaptationSets and the rx-player &#x201C;Adaptation&#x201D;</h1>
<p>The RxPlayer defines an <code>Adaptation</code> object (also sometimes called <code>Track</code>)
which follow as close as possible the concept of the <code>AdaptationSet</code> in
the DASH protocol.</p>
<p>However, to answer practically to some of the features allowed by DASH while
still respecting the <a href="https://dashif.org/guidelines/">DASH-IF &#x201C;IOP&#x201D;</a>, we had to
take some (minor) freedom with our interpretation of it.</p>
<p><a name="chapter-Merging%20of%20multiple%20AdaptationSets%20into%20a%20single%20Adaptation"></a></p>
<h2>Merging of multiple AdaptationSets into a single Adaptation</h2>
<p>The main difference is that all similar <code>AdaptationSet</code> which are marked as
&#x201C;seamlessly switchable&#x201D; between one another are merged into a single
<code>Adaptation</code> in the player.</p>
<p><a name="subchapter-Why%20do%20we%20do%20that"></a></p>
<h3>Why do we do that</h3>
<p>This &#x201C;switchable&#x201D; concept is for example used in cases were multiple encryption
keys are present for different <code>Representation</code> (e.g. due to limitations coming
from right holders).</p>
<p>The problem is that the DASH-IF tells us that all <code>Representation</code> in a given
<code>AdaptationSet</code> have to use the same license.
This means that in the aforementioned case, the concerned <code>Representation</code>
have to be divided into multiple <code>AdaptationSet</code>. In a player, different
<code>AdaptationSet</code> means different &#x201C;tracks&#x201D; and thus a player won&#x2019;t try to
automatically switch between them.</p>
<p>This means that our adaptive algorithm won&#x2019;t be able to set the right quality
and that the library user would have to manually manage that instead.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the DASH-IF IOP planned a work-around for that kind of situation:
To allow a player to seamlessly switch between multiple <code>AdaptationSets</code>, the
DASH-IF allows a specific node, called <code>SupplementalProperty</code> to be added as
children of the concerned <code>AdaptationSet</code>s (with a specific value).</p>
<p>However, this brings another set of issues in the rx-player, where this
separation would lead to an excessively complicated API.</p>
<p><a name="subchapter-What%20do%20we%20do"></a></p>
<h3>What do we do</h3>
<p>We thus decided to &#x201C;merge&#x201D; the <code>AdaptationSet</code>s into a single <code>Adaptation</code> if
all those conditions are filled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>they both support seamless-switching between one-another (i.e. they both
contain a <code>SupplementalProperty</code> node with the right values)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they represent the same type of content (&#x201C;audio&#x201D;, &#x201C;video&#x201D; or &#x201C;text&#x201D;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they are of the same language, if one (letter-for-letter in the manifest)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they have the same accessibility information (e.g. both are closed
captions or audio description for the visually impaired).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these conditions is not filled, the concerned <code>AdaptationSet</code>s stay
separated and the player will not try to switch between them.</p>
