<h1>Terms and definitions</h1>
<p><a name="overview"></a>
<a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As the RxPlayer manages multiple type of streaming technologies, which can use
their own definition and terminology, we had to find a compromise and use our
own terminology, which try to take the best from these.</p>
<p>We here define various terms used in the documentation which might not be
obvious right along.</p>
<p><a name="definitions"></a>
<a name="chapter-Definitions"></a></p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><a name="adaptation"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Adaptation"></a></p>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>Simply put, what we call an &#x201C;Adaptation&#x201D; is just an audio, video or text track.</p>
<p>More technically, it is an element of a <a href="#period">Period</a> (and by extension of
the <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>) which represents a single type of media.</p>
<p>An adaptation can be for example any of those things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A video track</li>
<li>A french audio track</li>
<li>An italian text track</li>
<li>A thumbnail track</li>
<li>&#x2026;</li>
</ul>
<p>Many Streaming Technology have this concept even though their name can change,
an Adaptation is equivalent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>DASH&#x2019;s <em>AdaptationSet</em></li>
<li>Microsoft Smooth Streaming&#x2019;s <em>StreamIndex</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: There is minor differences between the RxPlayer&#x2019;s <code>Adaptation</code> and DASH&#x2019;
<code>AdaptationSet</code>. Namely multiple <code>AdaptationSet</code>s can be merged into a single
<code>Adaptation</code> in very specific cases.
You can find more infos on it <a href="dash_rxplayer_adaptation_difference.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><a name="bitrate"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Bitrate"></a></p>
<h3>Bitrate</h3>
<p>In the RxPlayer, a bitrate of a <a href="#representation">Representation</a> indicates the
number of bits per second of content described by that Representation.</p>
<p>For example, let&#x2019;s imagine a video <a href="#adaptation">Adaptation</a> with two
Representation:</p>
<ol>
<li>one with a bitrate at <code>1,000,000</code> (which is 1 Megabit)</li>
<li>the other with a bitrate at <code>500,000</code> (which is 500 kilobits)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each seconds of content described by the first Representation will be
represented by 1 megabit of data</p>
<p>Each seconds for the second Representation will be represented by 500 kilobits.</p>
<p>Both will represent the same data, but the first one will need that the RxPlayer
fetch more data to show the same amount of content.</p>
<p>In most cases, a higher bitrate means a higher quality. That&#x2019;s why the RxPlayer
has to compromise between having the best quality and choosing a Representation
having a low-enough bitrate to be able to play on the user&#x2019;s computer without
needing to pause due to poor network conditions.</p>
<p><a name="buffer"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Buffer"></a></p>
<h3>Buffer</h3>
<p>When we talk about the &#x201C;buffer&#x201D; in the RxPlayer, it most likely mean one of two
things, depending on the context:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The media data currently loaded by the browser, ready to be decoded.</p>
<p>In the API, that&#x2019;s what we mean when we talk about the buffer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>modules in the RxPlayer downloading <a href="#segment">media segments</a> and doing
what is needed to play them.</p>
<p>Here you will mostly encounter that term in the architecture documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="type"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Buffer%20type"></a></p>
<h3>Buffer type</h3>
<p>RxPlayer&#x2019;s buffer types describe a single &#x201C;type&#x201D; of media.</p>
<p>Example of such types are:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#x201C;video&#x201D;: which represents only the video content</li>
<li>&#x201C;audio&#x201D;: the audio content without the video</li>
<li>&#x201C;text&#x201D;: the subtitles, for example</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are called buffer types here (or simply &#x201C;types&#x201D;) as each type will have
its own <a href="#buffer">Buffer</a> (in both sense of the term) in the RxPlayer.</p>
<p><a name="chunk"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Chunk"></a></p>
<h3>Chunk</h3>
<p>Depending on the context, a chunk can be either a sub-part of a <a href="#segment">Media
Segment</a> or the Media segment itself.</p>
<p><a name="init-segment"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Initialization%20segment"></a></p>
<h3>Initialization segment</h3>
<p>An initialization segment is a specific type of <a href="#segment">media segment</a>, which
includes metadata necessary to initialize the browser&#x2019;s internal decoder.</p>
<p>Those are sometimes needed before we can actually begin to push any &#x201C;real&#x201D; media
segment from the corresponding <a href="#representation">Representation</a>.</p>
<p>As such, when one is needed, the initialization segment is the first segment
downloaded for a given Representation.</p>
<p><a name="manifest"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Manifest"></a></p>
<h3>Manifest</h3>
<p>The Manifest is the generic name for the document which describes the content
you want to play.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the DASH&#x2019;s <em>Media Presentation Description</em> (or <em>MPD</em>),
the Microsoft Smooth Streaming&#x2019;s <em>Manifest</em> and the HLS&#x2019; <em>Master Playlist</em>.</p>
<p>Such document can describe for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple qualities for the same video or audio tracks</li>
<li>multiple audio tracks in different languages</li>
<li>presence of subtitles</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that this concept is only used in Streaming technologies.
You won&#x2019;t interact with a Manifest if you&#x2019;re directly playing a MP4 or webM
file.</p>
<p><a name="segment"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Media%20segment"></a></p>
<h3>Media segment</h3>
<p>A media segment (or simply segment), is a small chunk of media data.</p>
<p>In many streaming technologies, a content is separated into multiple chunks of
small duration (usually between 2 and 10 seconds).</p>
<p>This allows, for reasons to long to detail here, to easily implements many
features:</p>
<ul>
<li>live streaming,</li>
<li>language switching</li>
<li>adaptive streaming</li>
</ul>
<p>When you play a content with the RxPlayer, it will most of the time download
media segments of different types (audio, video, text&#x2026;) progressively rather
than the whole content at a single time.</p>
<p><a name="period"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Period"></a></p>
<h3>Period</h3>
<p>Simply put, a Period defines what the content will be from a starting time to
an ending time. It is an element contained in the <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>) and it
will contain the <a href="#adaptation">Adaptations</a> available for the corresponding
time period.</p>
<p>Depending on the transport used, they correspond to different concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>for DASH contents, it is more or less the same thing than an MPD&#x2019;s
<code>&lt;Period&gt;</code> element</li>
<li>for &#x201C;local&#x201D; contents, it corresponds to a single object from the <code>periods</code>
array.</li>
<li>for &#x201C;MetaPlaylist&#x201D; contents, it corresponds to all the Period elements we
retrieved after parsing the corresponding <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a> from the
elements of the <code>contents</code> array.</li>
<li>any other transport will have a single Period, describing the whole content.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#x2013;</p>
<p>As an example, let&#x2019;s take a manifest describing a live content with
chronologically:</p>
<ol>
<li>an english TV Show</li>
<li>an old italian film with subtitles</li>
<li>an American blockbuster with closed captions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say that those sub-contents are drastically different:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are all in different languages</li>
<li>the american blockbuster has more available video bitrates than the old
italian one</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the available tracks and available qualities are different from
sub-content to sub-content, we cannot just give a single list of Adaptations
valid for all of them. They have to be in some way separated in the Manifest
object.</p>
<p>That&#x2019;s a case where Periods will be used.
Here is a visual representation of how the Periods would be divided here:</p>
<pre><code>        Period 1                Period 2                Period 3
08h05              09h00                       10h30                 now
  |==================|===========================|====================|
        TV Show               Italian Film        American Blockbuster
</code></pre>
<p>Each of these Periods will be linked to different audio, video and text
Adaptations, themselves linked to different Representations.</p>
<p><a name="representation"></a>
<a name="subchapter-Representation"></a></p>
<h3>Representation</h3>
<p>A Representation is an element of an <a href="#adaptation">Adaptation</a>, and by extension
of the <a href="#manifest">Manifest</a>) that describes an interchangeable way to represent
the parent Adaptation.</p>
<p>For example, a video Adaptation can have several Representations, each having
its own bitrate, its own width or its own height.
The idea behind a Representation is that it can be changed by any other one in
the same Adaptation as the content plays.</p>
<p>This is most often implemented to allow multiple bitrates for the same
Adaptation, to be more flexible to poor network (low bandwidth) or computing
(slow computer) conditions.</p>
<p>A Representation has its equivalent in multiple Streaming technologies. It is
roughly the same as:</p>
<ul>
<li>DASH&#x2019;s <em>Representation</em></li>
<li>Microsoft Smooth Streaming&#x2019;s <em>QualityIndex</em></li>
<li>HLS&#x2019; <em>variant</em> (the notion of variant is actually a little more complex,
so here it&#x2019;s not an exact comparison)</li>
</ul>
