<h1>RxPlayer Architecture documentation</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The files in this directory and subdirectories establish a documentation about
the RxPlayer&#x2019;s architecture.</p>
<p>They are here to help you understand the way the player works, by describing
the different bricks and algorithms that come into play.</p>
<p><em>Note: As some terms used here might be too foreign or slightly different than
the one you&#x2019;re used to, we also wrote a list of terms and definitions used by
the RxPlayer <a href="../terms.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><a name="chapter-Organization%20of%20the%20documentation"></a></p>
<h2>Organization of the documentation</h2>
<p>The RxPlayer is heavily modularized.</p>
<p>This helps us maintaining the code and providing evolutions more quickly, as the
various modules use few well-defined interfaces with the rest of the code.
As such, the impact an evolution on a particular module has on the rest of the
code is controlled and limited to these interfaces.</p>
<p>Like the code, the documentation is also divided in multiple parts, which link
one by one to a module in the code.</p>
<p>Such modules are (with link to their respective documentation, if one):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>the <a href="api/index.html">API</a></strong></p>
<p>Defines the public API of the RxPlayer and provides abstractions to help
implementing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the <a href="stream/index.html">Stream</a></strong></p>
<p>starts playing a content and connects the different modules between one
another to allow continuous playback.</p>
<p>Various files documenting the Stream architecture should be available in the
<code>doc/architecture/stream</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the EMEManager</strong></p>
<p>Allows to handle contents with DRM (Digital Right Management).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the <a href="abr/index.html">ABRManager</a></strong></p>
<p>Helps to choose the best quality in the current content by analyzing the
current network, user settings and viewing conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the <a href="buffer/index.html">Buffer</a></strong></p>
<p>Choose which segments to download and push them to the corresponding
SourceBuffer.</p>
<p>Various files documenting the Stream architecture should be available in the
<code>doc/architecture/buffer</code> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the Source Buffers</strong></p>
<p>Provides abstractions on top of the SourceBuffers,
which are used to push media segments.
These files help to handle &#x201C;native&#x201D; SourceBuffers already defined by the
browser (for audio and video segments), but also define custom ones for
media managed entirely by the RxPlayer (example: subtitles and thumbnails).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Net</strong></p>
<p>Perform manifest/segment requests, and parse them.
<em>Net</em> in essence abstracts the transport protocol used (example:
HSS/DASH) to provide an unified definition of a segment or manifest to
the other modules.
In theory, it should be the only directory to update when adding /
modifying / deleting a transport protocol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>the <a href="pipelines/index.html">Pipelines</a></strong></p>
<p>Link the <em>Net</em> module with the rest of the code, to download segments,
download/refresh the manifest and collect data (such as the user&#x2019;s
bandwidth) for the other modules.</p>
<p>Various files documenting the Stream architecture should be available in the
<code>doc/architecture/pipelines</code> directory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The RxPlayer also has multiple isolated helpers (for manifest management,
segment parsing, browser compatibility) which are used by these different
modules.</p>
<p>A documentation about the file organization of the project is also available
<a href="files.html">here</a>.</p>
