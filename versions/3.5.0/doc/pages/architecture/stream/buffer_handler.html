<h1>BufferHandler</h1>
<p><a name="chapter-Overview"></a></p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To be able to play a content, the player has to be able to download chunks of
media data - called segments - and has to push them to SourceBuffers.</p>
<p>In the RxPlayer, it is the role of the <em>Buffers</em> to do all of those tasks.
The <em>BufferHandler</em> is a part of the <em>Stream</em> which dynamically creates and
remove <em>Buffers</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, the <em>Buffer Handler</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>dynamically creates various SourceBuffers depending on the needs of the
given content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>create and destroy <em>Buffers</em> linked to these SourceBuffers as the content
plays</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-Multiple%20types%20handling"></a></p>
<h2>Multiple types handling</h2>
<p>More often than not, content are divised into multiple &#x201C;types&#x201D;: &#x201C;audio&#x201D;, &#x201C;video&#x201D;
or &#x201C;text&#x201D; segments, for example. They are often completely distinct in a
manifest and as such, have to be downloaded and decoded separately.</p>
<p>Each type has its own <em>SourceBuffer</em>. For &#x201C;audio&#x201D;/&#x201C;video&#x201D; contents, we use
regular <em>MSE</em> SourceBuffers.
For any other types, such as &#x201C;text&#x201D; and &#x201C;image&#x201D;, we defined custom SourceBuffers
implementation adapted to these type of contents.</p>
<p>We then create a different Buffer for each type. Each will progressively
download and push content of their respective type to their respective
SourceBuffer:</p>
<pre><code>- AUDIO BUFFER _
|======================    |

- VIDEO BUFFER _
|==================        |

- TEXT BUFFER _
|========================  |

- IMAGE BUFFER _
|====================      |
</code></pre>
<p><em>(the <code>|</code> sign delimits the temporal start and end of a Buffer, the <code>=</code> sign
represent a pushed segment in the corresponding SourceBuffer)</em></p>
<p><a name="chapter-Native%20SourceBuffers"></a></p>
<h2>Native SourceBuffers</h2>
<p>SourceBuffers created for the audio and/or video types are called <em>native
SourceBuffers</em>. This is because their management is managed by the browser,
hence it&#x2019;s a &#x201C;native&#x201D; implementation.
SourceBuffers for any other possible types (for example &#x201C;text&#x201D; and &#x201C;image&#x201D;) are
called <em>custom SourceBuffers</em>. This is because their management is done by the
RxPlayer, to emulate the native behavior.</p>
<p>Native SourceBuffers have several differences with the custom ones, especially:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They are managed by the browser where custom ones are implemented in JS.
As such, they must obey to various browser rules, among which:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They cannot be lazily created as the content plays. We have to
initialize all native SourceBuffers beforehand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have to be linked to a specific codec.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have to be added to the MediaSource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have to be added to the MediaSource after the media HTMLElement
has been linked to the MediaSource</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are in a way more &#x201C;important&#x201D; than custom ones. If a problem happens
with a native SourceBuffer, we interrupt playback. For a custom one, we can
just deactivate the SourceBuffer for the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They affect buffering when custom SourceBuffers do not (no text segment for
a part of the content means we will just not have subtitles, no audio
segment means we will completely stop to await them)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They affect various API linked to the media element in the DOM. Such as
<code>HTMLMediaElement.prototype.buffered</code>.
Custom SourceBuffers do not.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to these differences, native SourceBuffers are often managed in a less
permissive way than custom ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They will be created at the very start of the content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An error coming from one of them will lead us to completely stop the content
on a fatal error</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="chapter-PeriodBuffers"></a></p>
<h2>PeriodBuffers</h2>
<p>The <em>DASH</em> streaming technology has a concept called <em>Period</em>. Simply put, it
allows to set various types of content successively in the same manifest.</p>
<p>For example, let&#x2019;s take a manifest describing a live content with
chronologically:</p>
<ol>
<li>an english TV Show</li>
<li>an old italian film with subtitles</li>
<li>an American film with closed captions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>08h05              09h00                       10h30                now
  |==================|===========================|===================|
        TV Show               Italian Film            American film
</code></pre>
<p>Those contents are drastically different (they have different languages, the
american film might have more available bitrates than the old italian one).</p>
<p>Moreover, even a library user might want to be able to know when the italian
film is finished, to report about it immediately in a graphical interface.</p>
<p>As such, they have to be considered separately - in a different Period:</p>
<pre><code>        Period 1                Period 2                Period 3
08h05              09h00                       10h30                now
  |==================|===========================|===================|
        TV Show               Italian Film            American film
</code></pre>
<p>In the RxPlayer, we create one <em>Buffer</em> per Period <strong>and</strong> per type.
Those are called <em>PeriodBuffers</em>.</p>
<p><em>PeriodBuffers</em> are automatically created/destroyed during playback. The job of
a single <em>PeriodBuffer</em> is to process and download optimally the content linked
to a single <em>Period</em> and to a single type:</p>
<pre><code>- VIDEO BUFFER -

     PERIOD BUFFER
08h05              09h00
  |=========         |
        TV Show


- AUDIO BUFFER -

     PERIOD BUFFER
08h05              09h00
  |=============     |
        TV Show


- TEXT BUFFER -

     PERIOD BUFFER
08h05              09h00
  |======            |
        TV Show
</code></pre>
<p>To allow smooth transitions between them, we also might want to preload content
defined by a subsequent <em>Period</em> once we lean towards the end of the content
described by the previous one.
Thus, multiple <em>PeriodBuffers</em> might be active at the same time:</p>
<pre><code>+----------------------------   AUDIO   ----------------------------------+
|                                                                         |
|      PERIOD BUFFER 1        PERIOD BUFFER 2         PERIOD BUFFER 3     | 
| 08h05              09h00                       10h30                now |

<h3>Multi-Period management</h3>
<p>The creation/destruction of <em>PeriodBuffers</em> by the Stream is actually done in a
very precize and optimal way, which gives a higher priority to immediate
content.</p>
<p>To better grasp how it works, let&#x2019;s imagine a regular use-case, with two periods
for a single type of Buffer:</p>
<hr>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say that the <em>PeriodBuffer</em> for the first <em>Period</em> (named P1) is currently
actively downloading segments (the &#x201C;^&#x201D; sign is the current position):</p>
<pre><code>   P1
|====  |
   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Once P1 is full (it has no segment left to download):</p>
<pre><code>   P1
|======|
   ^
</code></pre>
<p>We will be able to create a new <em>PeriodBuffer</em>, P2, for the second <em>Period</em>:</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|======|      |
   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Which will then also download segments:</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|======|==    |
   ^
</code></pre>
<p>If P1 needs segments again however (e.g. when the bitrate changes&#x2026;)</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|===   |==    |
   ^
</code></pre>
<p>Then we will destroy P2, to keep it from downloading segments:</p>
<pre><code>   P1
|===   |
   ^
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>Once P1, goes full again, we re-create P2:</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|======|==    |
   ^
</code></pre>
<p><em>Note that we still have the segment pushed to P2 available</em></p>
<p>When the current position go ahead of a <em>PeriodBuffer</em> (here ahead of P1):</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|======|===   |
        ^
</code></pre>
<p>This <em>PeriodBuffer</em> is destroyed to free up ressources:</p>
<pre><code>          P2
       |===   |
        ^
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>When the current position goes behind the first currently defined <em>PeriodBuffer</em>:</p>
<pre><code>          P2
       |===   |
    ^
</code></pre>
<p>Then we destroy all previous <em>PeriodBuffers</em> and [re-]create the one needed:</p>
<pre><code>   P1
|======|
    ^
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, P1 is full (as we already downloaded its segments) so we also
can re-create P2, which will also keep its already-pushed segments:</p>
<pre><code>   P1     P2
|======|===   |
    ^
</code></pre>
<hr>
<p>For multiple types of Buffers (example: <em>audio</em> and <em>video</em>) the same logic is
repeated (and separated) as many times. An <em>audio</em> <em>PeriodBuffer</em> will not
influence a <em>video</em> one:</p>
<pre><code>---------------------------   AUDIO   --------------------------------
     Period 1         Period 2
|================|=============   |
     ^

---------------------------   VIDEO   --------------------------------
     Period 1
|=======         |
     ^

----------------------------   TEXT   --------------------------------
     Period 1         Period 2          Period 3
|================| (NO SUBTITLES) |================   |
     ^
</code></pre>
<p>At the end, we should only have <em>PeriodBuffer[s]</em> for consecutive Period[s]:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first chronological one is the one currently seen by the user.</li>
<li>The last chronological one is the only one downloading content.</li>
<li>In between, we only have full consecutive <em>PeriodBuffers</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="subchapter-Communication%20with%20the%20API"></a></p>
<h3>Communication with the API</h3>
<p>The Stream communicates to the API about creations and destructions of
<em>PeriodBuffers</em> respectively through <code>&quot;periodBufferReady&quot;</code> and
<code>&quot;periodBufferCleared&quot;</code> events.</p>
<p>When the currently seen Period changes, an <code>activePeriodChanged</code> event is
sent.</p>
