# RxPlayer scripts #############################################################

This directory contains various scripts allowing to perform various actions on
the RxPlayer:
  - Serving/deploying the demo pages
  - Generating complex builds
  - Performing repetitive action performed before each release
  - and many other things

Each script here should begin with a comment explaining what it does and - if
it's not obvious - why this is needed.
