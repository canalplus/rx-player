 * Run the standalone demo server

 * This script allows to build the standalone demo locally and start both an
 * HTTP and an HTTPS (only if a certificate and key have been generated) server
 * to serve it, on the port 8001 and 8444 respectively.
 *
 * You can run it as a script through `node run_standalone_demo.js`.
 * Be aware that this demo will be built again every time one of the library
 * file is updated.
