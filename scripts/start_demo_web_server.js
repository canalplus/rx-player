 * Run the full demo server
 * =========================
 *
 * This script allows to build the full demo locally and start both an HTTP and
 * an HTTPS (only if a certificate and key have been generated) server to serve
 * it, on the port 8000 and 8443 respectively.
 *
 * You can run it as a script through `node start_demo_web_server.js`.
 * Be aware that this demo will be built again every time either one of the
 * full demo file or one of the library file is updated.
