# make-dev-releases
# =================
#
# This script produces pre-releases on top of the current branch for the
# `worker` and `canal-worker` versions (as per their npm tags).
#
# To use it:
#
#   1. Be sure that you're on the branch corresponding to the pre-release you
#      want to publish, at the repository's root directory.
#
#   2. Call this script followed with the corresponding version number it would
#      have as an official release in the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (e.g.
#      `./update-version 4.1.3`). Special suffix corresponding to the date and
#      tag will be added automatically by this script.
#
#      Optionally, this script can take a supplementary argument, which is the
#      increment number (For example `update-version 4.1.3 01`), which is set to
#      `00` if that argument is not set (as is wanted for the first and
#      hopefully only release in a given day).
#      This is for cases where you're doing multiple releases in a single day,
#      allowing you to increment that value for each of these releases and avoid
#      release naming conflicts.
#
#   3. When the script ask you to confirm, check that the preceding commands did
#      not output any issue and if it didn't you can confirm.
#
#   4. That's it!
