# make-dev-releases
# =================
#
# This script produces pre-releases on top of the current branch for the
# `worker` and `canal-worker` versions (as per their npm tags).
#
# To use it:
#
#   1. Be sure that you're on the branch corresponding to the pre-release you
#      want to publish, at the repository's root directory.
#
#   2. Call this script followed with the corresponding version number it would
#      have as an official release in the `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format (e.g.
#      `./update-version 4.1.3`). Special suffix corresponding to the date and
#      tag will be added automatically by this script.
#
#   3. When the script ask you to confirm, check that the preceding commands did
#      not output any issue and if it didn't you can confirm.
#
#   4. That's it!
