# make-dev-releases
# =================
#
# This script produces pre-releases on top of the current branch for the
# `dev` and `canal` versions (as per their npm tags).
#
# To use it:
#
#   1. Be sure that you're on the branch corresponding to the pre-release you
#      want to publish, at the repository's root directory.
#
#   2. Call this script.
#
#      You may optionally provide two arguments:
#
#        - the version number (e.g. 5.124.13)
#
#        - the "increment number", set to `00` by default (as is wanted for the
#          first and hopefully only release in a given day).
#
#          This is for cases where you're doing multiple releases in a single
#          day, allowing you to increment that value for each of these releases
#          and avoid release naming conflicts.
#
#      If you forget one of those arguments or both, the script will ask you
#      to enter those instead.
#
#   3. When the script asks you to confirm, check that the preceding commands
#      did not output any issue and if it didn't you can confirm.
#
#   4. That's it!
