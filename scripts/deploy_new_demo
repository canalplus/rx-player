# Deploy new demo
# ====================
#
# This script allows to automatically create a new demo page on the gh-pages
# branch.
# /!\ This script deploy a non-minified version.
#
# To use it:
#
#   1. Check that you're on the branch you want to deploy and that this branch
#      is clean (has no staged files or diff)
#
#   2. Call this script with the wanted directory name in argument (e.g.
#      `./deploy_new_demo my_new_page`).
#      Some user interactions will be needed to avoid doing unwanted commits.
#
#   3. That's it!
#      A commit with the new directory should have been pushed to the gh-pages.
