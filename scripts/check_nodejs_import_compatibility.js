/**
 * # check_nodejs_import_compatibility
 *
 * This is a node.js script which tries to import the RxPlayer various exports
 * and check if every one of them seems to be importable without issue.
 *
 * The goal is to check if the RxPlayer, at the origin made to run in a browser
 * environment, can still be imported through node.js in specific cases like
 * when the application uses [poorly optimized] server-side rendering.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * To be able to run this script:
 *
 *   1. You need first to produce the modular "minimal" build of the RxPlayer
 *
 *   2. You need to make sure that `import` statements can be used in the
 *      node.js runtime you've ran. This possibility might depends on the
 *      usage of supplementary supplementary packages like `esm`.
 *
 * After running this script, you know if it ran succesfully by seeing the
 * string "SUCCESS!" being outputed to STDOUT.
 *
 * If it doesn't work, you should see a corresponding error output to STDERR.
